## RAPID IMPLEMENTATION FOCUS

### Infrastructure Tasks
1. Production Preparation (PRIORITY 1) ðŸš€
   - Deployment Verification:
     - Test failover scenarios
     - Verify backup procedures
     - Check monitoring alerts
     - Validate security measures
   
   - Documentation:
     - Update deployment guides
     - Document recovery procedures
     - Create runbooks
     - Add troubleshooting guides

2. Cost Optimization (PRIORITY 2) ðŸ”„
   - Resource Analysis:
     - Review current usage
     - Identify optimization opportunities
     - Track cost metrics
     - Set up budgets
   
   - Performance Tuning:
     - Optimize Redis configuration
     - Review network settings
     - Adjust monitoring retention
     - Fine-tune alerts

### Backend Tasks
1. Backup Procedures (PRIORITY 1) ðŸš€
   - Automated Backups:
     - Configure backup schedule
     - Set up verification process
     - Test restore procedures
     - Document recovery steps
   
   - Data Integrity:
     - Verify backup contents
     - Test restore accuracy
     - Monitor backup performance
     - Track success rates

2. System Maintenance (PRIORITY 2) ðŸ”„
   - Log Management:
     - Configure log rotation
     - Set retention policies
     - Monitor disk usage
     - Archive old logs
   
   - Security Scanning:
     - Set up vulnerability scans
     - Configure audit logging
     - Monitor access patterns
     - Track security metrics

## Working Style
1. Verification First:
   - Test before implementing/deploying
   - Verify all changes
   - Document procedures
   - Monitor results

2. Security Focus:
   - Follow AWS and system best practices
   - Test security measures
   - Monitor for issues
   - Document procedures

3. Performance and Cost:
   - Monitor metrics and spending
   - Track resource usage
   - Optimize operations
   - Document baselines

## Communication Guidelines
1. Update PROGRESS.md after:
   - Testing deployments/backups
   - Verifying changes
   - Updating documentation
   - Finding issues
   - Optimizing systems

2. Include in updates:
   - Deployment/backup status
   - Test results
   - Security findings
   - Performance metrics
   - Cost analysis
   - Next steps

Remember: Excellence through verified progress

## Redis Configuration
1. Local Development:
   ```python
   import redis

   # Local Redis
   redis_client = redis.Redis(
       host='localhost',
       port=6379,
       decode_responses=True
   )
   ```

2. Production/Staging:
   ```python
   import redis

   # ElastiCache Redis
   redis_client = redis.Redis(
       host=os.getenv('REDIS_HOST'),
       port=int(os.getenv('REDIS_PORT', 6379)),
       ssl=True,
       ssl_cert_reqs=None,  # For self-signed certs
       decode_responses=True
   )
   ```

3. Verification:
   ```bash
   # Local Redis
   redis-cli ping
   redis-cli info | grep version

   # ElastiCache Redis
   python -c "import redis; r = redis.Redis(host='YOUR-REDIS.cache.amazonaws.com', port=6379, ssl=True); r.ping()"
   ```
