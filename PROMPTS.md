## ðŸš¨ STOP TESTING - VERIFY REAL FUNCTIONALITY

1. Kill test process:
   ```bash
   pkill -f "npm test"
   ```

2. Start dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```
   Server running at: http://localhost:5176

3. Verify in browser:
   - Open http://localhost:5176
   - Send test message
   - Check message received
   - Try RAG query
   - Check performance

Rest of verification plan follows...

## ðŸš¨ VERIFY & DEPLOY - DONE BY 7:45 PM

### PHASE 1: Core Features (7:00-7:20 PM)
1. Message Flow
   - Server starts?
   - Client connects?
   - Messages send/receive?
   - Basic errors handled?

2. RAG System
   - Responds to queries?
   - Basic context works?
   - Errors handled?
   - Performance okay?

### PHASE 2: Deploy (7:20-7:45 PM)
1. Merge to Main (7:20-7:25)
   ```bash
   # Switch to main and pull
   cd /home/jon/git/aether
   git checkout main
   git pull

   # Merge our changes
   git merge feature/websocket
   git push
   ```

2. Railway Setup (7:25-7:35)
   ```bash
   # Build check
   npm run build
   
   # Deploy
   railway up
   ```

3. Final Verify (7:35-7:45)
   - Messages work in prod
   - RAG works in prod
   - Performance good

## âš¡ Verification Commands
```bash
# Quick Build Check
npm run build

# Dev Server
npm run dev

# Deploy
railway up
```
