# Towards MVP: Progressive Development Plan

## Core Purpose
Aether Chat enables team members to take time off while maintaining team communication flow through an AI stand-in that:
- References their past conversations to understand context and communication style
- Uses provided reference documents to maintain domain knowledge
- Gives contextually appropriate responses to colleagues' questions
- Maintains the team's flow state by reducing vacation-related disruptions

## Progressive MVP Strategy

### Turtle 1: Core Chat Demo (45 minutes)
Focus on ONE working flow demonstrating core Slack-like features:
- Real-time messaging between users
- Basic channel support
- Simple authentication
- Message persistence
- Clean, minimal UI
- Local storage for demo
This provides a submittable baseline chat app with technical foundation for AI.

### Turtle 2: AI Stand-in Basic (2 hours)
Add essential AI features while maintaining core chat functionality:
- Claude integration for message responses
- Basic RAG over chat history
- Simple prompt templates
- AI status indicators
- Local document storage
This demonstrates the core AI avatar concept with one working path.

### Turtle 3: Enhanced AI Features
Build out the complete AI stand-in capabilities:
- Full chat history RAG
- Communication style matching
- Reference document integration
- Vacation coverage setup
- Rich context handling
This delivers the full vision of AI-powered team communication.

## Current State

### Backend (80% Complete)
- Core RAG system implementation in place at `src/rag_aether/ai/rag_system.py`
- Using Claude 3 Opus for LLM integration
- Secrets management set up using `pass` for API keys
- Environment setup script (`setup_env.sh`) configured
- Dependencies managed through Poetry

### Frontend (40% Complete)
- Basic React setup
- Chat interface structure
- File upload functionality
- Real-time features pending
- UI/UX polish needed

### Infrastructure (60% Complete)
- Poetry environment
- Testing infrastructure
- Basic CI/CD
- Docker optimization pending
- Cloud deployment pending

## Next Steps

### 1. Core Functionality
- [ ] Verify message ingestion from chat into RAG system
- [ ] Test search functionality over chat history
- [ ] Implement basic error handling and retries
- [ ] Add logging for debugging
- [ ] Add reference document ingestion for vacation coverage
- [ ] Implement communication style matching

### 2. Frontend Development
- [ ] Integrate RAG search into chat interface
- [ ] Display relevant past messages in context
- [ ] Implement response display
- [ ] Add loading states
- [ ] Add interface for setting vacation coverage
- [ ] Show AI stand-in status clearly

### 3. Testing
- [ ] Add unit tests for RAG system with mock conversations
- [ ] Add integration tests for chat-RAG integration
- [ ] Set up frontend testing
- [ ] Test vacation coverage scenarios
- [ ] Verify communication style consistency

### 4. Documentation
- [ ] Document API endpoints
- [ ] Add setup instructions
- [ ] Create usage examples
- [ ] Document chat-RAG integration pattern
- [ ] Guide for preparing vacation coverage

### 5. DevOps
- [ ] Set up proper development workflow
- [ ] Configure CI/CD
- [ ] Add health monitoring
- [ ] Monitor AI stand-in performance

## Current Issues
1. Need to verify Claude integration is working with the API key
2. Need to test chat message ingestion and search flow
3. Frontend-backend integration needs testing
4. Need to implement vacation coverage setup flow
5. Need to test AI stand-in response quality

## Development Guidelines
1. Use Poetry for Python dependency management
2. Store secrets using `pass`
3. Follow existing patterns in the codebase
4. Keep MVP focused on core chat-RAG functionality
5. Prioritize response quality and style matching
6. Build progressively through turtle-based MVPs
