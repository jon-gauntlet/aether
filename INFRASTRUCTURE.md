## Key Learnings

### 1. Docker Networking
- Successfully configured communication between services using Docker networks
- Resolved DNS resolution issues between containers
- Implemented proper service discovery

### 2. Database Integration
- Optimized Supabase connection handling
- Implemented proper JSON metadata serialization
- Set up efficient connection pooling

### 3. Frontend Optimization
- Configured Nginx for optimal performance
- Implemented security headers
- Set up proper caching strategies
- Configured API proxying

### 4. Performance Optimization
- Reduced Docker build times to under 10 minutes
- Implemented proper resource limits
- Optimized dependency installation
- Configured proper health checks

## Vision
The infrastructure is designed to support a scalable, maintainable, and secure RAG system with:
- Clear separation of concerns between services
- Robust error handling and monitoring
- Efficient resource utilization
- Security best practices
- Developer-friendly local setup

## Next Steps

### Short Term (Next 24 Hours)
1. Add automated testing pipeline
2. Implement rate limiting
3. Add more detailed metrics
4. Set up logging aggregation

### Medium Term (Next Week)
1. Implement CI/CD pipeline
2. Add performance monitoring
3. Set up backup strategy
4. Implement auto-scaling

### Long Term (Next Month)
1. Add distributed tracing
2. Implement blue-green deployments
3. Set up disaster recovery
4. Add security scanning

## Known Issues
1. Frontend container occasionally requires multiple restarts
2. Redis persistence needs optimization
3. Supabase connection pooling could be improved
