# Aether Recovery Status

## Recovery Process

The project has undergone a significant recovery and reorganization process. Here's a summary of the actions taken:

### 1. File Organization
- Created proper directory structure in `/src/core`
- Moved files to appropriate directories based on functionality
- Renamed files with descriptive names
- Fixed import paths
- Cleaned up backup files and empty directories

### 2. Directory Structure
Files have been organized into the following structure:

- `/energy` - Energy system files
- `/evolution` - Evolution-related files
- `/flow` - Flow system files
- `/integration` - Integration components
- `/js` - JavaScript utilities
- `/natural` - Natural system files
- `/pattern` - Pattern system files
- `/patterns` - Pattern implementations
- `/protection` - Protection system files
- `/services` - Core services
- `/space` - Space system files
- `/system` - Core system files
- `/test` - Test files
- `/types` - Type definitions

### 3. Type Organization
Type definitions have been organized into specific categories:

- `/types/autonomic` - Autonomic system types
- `/types/context` - Context types
- `/types/energy` - Energy system types
- `/types/flow` - Flow system types
- `/types/patterns` - Pattern types
- `/types/protection` - Protection types
- `/types/space` - Space system types
- `/types/utils` - Utility types
- `/types/validation` - Validation types

## Current Status

### Completed Tasks
- ✅ Directory structure creation
- ✅ File categorization
- ✅ File renaming
- ✅ Import path fixes
- ✅ Backup file cleanup
- ✅ Type organization
- ✅ Version control integration

### Remaining Tasks
1. Review and update documentation
2. Validate all import paths
3. Add missing type definitions
4. Complete test coverage
5. Update build configuration

## Protection Measures

To prevent future data loss and maintain organization:

1. **Version Control**
   - Regular commits
   - Descriptive commit messages
   - Branch protection rules

2. **File Organization**
   - Strict directory structure
   - Clear naming conventions
   - Type safety enforcement

3. **Backup System**
   - Regular backups
   - Multiple backup locations
   - Automated backup verification

4. **Code Quality**
   - Linting rules
   - Type checking
   - Test coverage requirements
   - Code review process

## Next Steps

1. **Documentation**
   - Update API documentation
   - Add inline code comments
   - Create development guides

2. **Testing**
   - Add missing tests
   - Improve test coverage
   - Add integration tests

3. **Type Safety**
   - Review type definitions
   - Add missing types
   - Enforce strict type checking

4. **Build Process**
   - Update build configuration
   - Add build validation
   - Implement CI/CD pipeline

## Known Issues

1. Some files may have incorrect import paths
2. Test coverage may be incomplete
3. Documentation needs updating
4. Some type definitions may be missing

## Recovery Verification

To verify the recovery:

1. Run the test suite
2. Check build process
3. Validate import paths
4. Review type coverage
5. Test core functionality
