# Aether Recovery Status

## Recovery Timeline
- Initial data loss incident occurred
- Recovery process initiated through Cursor editor history
- Core system files recovered
- Test files and implementations restored

## Recovered Components

### Core Systems
1. **Energy System**
   - ✅ `useEnergy.ts` - Core energy management hook
   - ✅ Energy system tests

2. **Autonomic System**
   - ✅ `useAutonomic.ts` - Autonomic development hook
   - ✅ Autonomic system tests
   - ✅ `AutonomicDevelopment.tsx` - Main component
   - ✅ Component tests

3. **Pattern System**
   - ✅ `PatternVisualization.tsx` - Pattern display component
   - ✅ Pattern visualization tests

### Current Status
All major system components have been recovered, including:
- Core hooks and their implementations
- Test suites for all recovered components
- React components and their tests
- Type definitions and interfaces

### Recovered Files
1. `src/core/energy/useEnergy.ts`
2. `src/core/energy/__tests__/useEnergy.test.tsx`
3. `src/core/autonomic/useAutonomic.ts`
4. `src/core/autonomic/__tests__/useAutonomic.test.tsx`
5. `src/components/AutonomicDevelopment.tsx`
6. `src/components/__tests__/AutonomicDevelopment.test.tsx`
7. `src/components/PatternVisualization.tsx`
8. `src/components/__tests__/PatternVisualization.test.tsx`

### Known Issues
1. Some linter errors present:
   - Missing module declarations
   - Import resolution issues
   - Type definition conflicts

### Next Steps
1. Resolve linter errors by:
   - Creating missing type definition files
   - Fixing import paths
   - Adding missing dependencies
2. Verify system integration
3. Add missing test coverage
4. Restore remaining components

### Recovery Process
1. Files were recovered using Cursor editor history
2. Each file was validated for completeness
3. Test files were recovered to ensure functionality
4. Component hierarchy was restored
5. Documentation was updated to reflect current state

## Protection Measures
To prevent future data loss:
1. Regular git commits
2. Automated backups
3. Protected workspace paths
4. Clear documentation
5. Version control best practices
