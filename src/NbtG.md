# AI System Evolution

> Evolving Invisible Infrastructure into a truly autonomic system through Local LLM integration.

## Project Vision
The AI System Evolution project aims to transform our current rule-based Invisible Infrastructure into an AI-enhanced system that truly understands and actualizes its principles. See [VISION.md](./VISION.md) for the complete vision.

## System Requirements

### Current System Specifications
- **OS**: Arch Linux 6.12.8-arch1-1
- **CPU**: 13th Gen Intel Core i7-1355U (12 cores)
- **RAM**: 16GB (15GB usable)
- **Swap**: 16GB
- **Storage**: Requires minimum 50GB free space

### Optimization Targets
- Maximum RAM usage for LLM: 4GB
- Background services: <1GB combined
- Swap usage: Minimize for performance
- CPU utilization: Optimize for laptop thermals
- Context storage: <10GB

## Key Documentation
- [Vision Document](./VISION.md): Complete project vision and goals
- [Infrastructure Documentation](./docs/infrastructure/INVISIBLE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md): Current system state
- [Focus Tools](./docs/focus/FOCUS_TOOLS.md): Integration with focus management

## Core Principles
1. AI enhances, never replaces, sacred principles
2. Evolution respects system foundations
3. Integration preserves existing strengths
4. Understanding grows naturally
5. System coherence is maintained
6. Resource usage remains optimized

## Getting Started
1. Read the [Vision Document](./VISION.md)
2. Review current [Infrastructure](./docs/infrastructure/INVISIBLE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
3. Understand [Focus Tools](./docs/focus/FOCUS_TOOLS.md) integration
4. Follow development in project directories

## System Optimization Notes
- LLM models selected for 16GB RAM constraint
- Services designed for laptop power profile
- Resource allocation respects Focus Tools
- Swap usage optimized for SSD longevity
- Background tasks throttled during focus

## Remember
The goal is not to replace the invisible hand of infrastructure, but to give it the wisdom to truly understand its purpose.
