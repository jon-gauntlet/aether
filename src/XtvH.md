# AI System Evolution

> Evolving Invisible Infrastructure into a truly autonomic system through Local LLM integration.

## Project Vision
The AI System Evolution project aims to transform our current rule-based Invisible Infrastructure into an AI-enhanced system that truly understands and actualizes its principles. See [VISION.md](./VISION.md) for the complete vision.

## Key Documentation
- [Vision Document](./VISION.md): Complete project vision and goals
- [Infrastructure Documentation](./docs/infrastructure/INVISIBLE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md): Current system state
- [Focus Tools](./docs/focus/FOCUS_TOOLS.md): Integration with focus management

## Core Principles
1. AI enhances, never replaces, sacred principles
2. Evolution respects system foundations
3. Integration preserves existing strengths
4. Understanding grows naturally
5. System coherence is maintained

```

## Getting Started
1. Read the [Vision Document](./VISION.md)
2. Review current [Infrastructure](./docs/infrastructure/INVISIBLE_INFRASTRUCTURE.md)
3. Understand [Focus Tools](./docs/focus/FOCUS_TOOLS.md) integration
4. Follow development in project directories

## Remember
The goal is not to replace the invisible hand of infrastructure, but to give it the wisdom to truly understand its purpose.
