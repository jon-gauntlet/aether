## Exercise Style Guide: Biblical References in Python Koans

This repository uses Biblical references from the New King James Version (NKJV) to provide spiritual context and wisdom alongside technical learning. Each exercise should follow these guidelines:

### Structure

1. **Module Header**
- Begin with a Proverbs or Psalms quote about wisdom/learning
- Example: `'The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge' (Proverbs 1:7)`

2. **Function Docstrings**
- Include relevant NKJV scripture that thematically matches the concept
- Follow with a plain explanation of the technical concept
- Example:
```python
"""'The earth was without form, and void' (Genesis 1:2)
What is the sum of nothing? As in the beginning, we start with void."""
```

### Biblical Sources Priority

1. **Wisdom Literature**
- Proverbs: For principles and foundational concepts
- Ecclesiastes: For patterns and cycles
- Psalms: For meditation and understanding

2. **New Testament**
- Gospels: For practical teachings
- Epistles: For deeper understanding
- James: For practical wisdom
- Revelation: For complex patterns

3. **Old Testament**
- Genesis: For beginnings and foundations
- Prophets: For vision and insight

### Thematic Mappings

Match programming concepts with appropriate Biblical themes:

1. **Fundamentals**
- Empty/None: Genesis 1:2 (void and formless)
- Unity: Psalm 133:1 (dwelling in unity)
- Patterns: Ecclesiastes 3:1-8 (seasons and patterns)

2. **Data Structures**
- Arrays: Matthew 13:30 (gathering)
- Trees: Psalm 1:3 (tree planted by waters)
- Graphs: Proverbs 3:17 (paths of wisdom)

3. **Algorithms**
- Sorting: 1 Corinthians 14:40 (done in order)
- Searching: Luke 15 (seeking what is lost)
- Recursion: Psalm 145:4 (generation to generation)

### Style Rules

1. **Scripture Selection**
- Choose verses that naturally relate to the concept
- Prefer direct connections over forced metaphors
- Use complete verses when context matters

2. **Commentary Style**
- Keep technical explanations clear and separate
- Use scripture as illumination, not just decoration
- Maintain reverent tone while being educational

3. **Progression**
- Start with foundational scriptures
- Build to more complex spiritual/technical concepts
- Mirror the journey of understanding in both domains

### Example Exercise Structure

```python
"""
Path to Python Enlightenment - [Topic]

'[Wisdom scripture from Proverbs/Psalms]'
Let us begin our journey of understanding with patience and wisdom.
"""

def test_concept():
    """'[Relevant NKJV scripture]'
    [Technical explanation]"""
    assert_equal(__, implementation())
```

### Implementation Notes

1. Each new exercise should be reviewed for:
- Biblical accuracy and appropriate context
- Technical clarity and educational value
- Proper attribution of scriptures

2. Maintain a balance between:
- Spiritual wisdom and technical learning
- Simplicity and depth
- Theory and practice

Remember: The goal is to create a learning experience that enriches both spiritual and technical understanding while maintaining respect for both domains.
