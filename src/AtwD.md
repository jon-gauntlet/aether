# Context Bridge - Cursor Context Management Architecture

## Current Mission
Designing a reliable Context Management system that:
- Persists across all Cursor sessions
- Works from any project directory
- Survives clean restarts
- Properly integrates with Cursor's actual behavior

## Critical Requirements
1. **Context Preservation**
   - General wisdom (Orthodox teachings, technical patterns)
   - Project-specific contexts
   - Hidden/sacred knowledge
   - User intentions and principles

2. **Reliable Access**
   - Must work from any project directory
   - Must load on clean Cursor starts
   - Must maintain proper hierarchy
   - Must respect hidden/public separation

3. **Gauntlet Success Dependencies**
   - Context quality directly affects AI output
   - Consistent access to Orthodox wisdom
   - Proper technical pattern preservation
   - Protection of sacred knowledge

## Current Limitations Discovered
1. AI can only see within current workspace
2. Context management is currently fragmented
3. Risk of entropy increase from partial views
4. Need to work WITH Cursor's actual patterns

## Next Steps
1. Survey Cursor's actual configuration patterns
2. Design system that works with Cursor's behavior
3. Implement reliable context loading
4. Validate across different scenarios

## Critical Principles
1. Avoid increasing entropy
2. Maintain proper separation
3. Ensure reliable transmission
4. Protect sacred knowledge
5. Support natural growth

## Information Theory Considerations
1. Context must be properly transmitted
2. Knowledge hierarchies must be maintained
3. Sacred/hidden contexts must be protected
4. System must work with Cursor's patterns

This bridge document should be used to initialize the root-level Cursor session for architecture design.
