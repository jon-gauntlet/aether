## Package Management
- Primary: pacman (Arch)
- AUR Helper: yay
- Python: poetry
- Node: npm

## Core Principles

### 1. DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation
- Applies to:
  - Code: Use functions, classes, and modules for reusability
  - Documentation: Single source of truth, link don't copy
  - Configuration: Use templates and inheritance
  - Knowledge: Centralize and reference, don't duplicate
- Implementation:
  - Use LLMs to identify and refactor duplicated patterns
  - Maintain central knowledge bases
  - Create reusable templates and snippets
  - Automate repetitive tasks

### 2. Eliminate Toil
- Definition: Manual, repetitive work that can be automated
- Target areas:
  - Manual troubleshooting: Use LLMs and automation
  - Reading source code: Let LLMs analyze and summarize
  - Documentation parsing: Automated extraction of key points
  - Repetitive debugging: Automated diagnosis
  - Configuration management: Templates and generators
- Implementation:
  - LLMs for code analysis and generation
  - Automated testing and validation
  - Smart completion and suggestions
  - Context-aware tooling
  - Workflow automation
- Benefits:
  - Preserve mental energy
  - Maintain flow states
  - Focus on creative work
  - Reduce frustration
  - Increase productivity

## Notes
- Running KDE Plasma desktop environment
- Using Konsole as terminal emulator
- zsh with oh-my-zsh as shell
- Heavy focus on AI development and automation
- Optimized for long coding sessions (80-100 hours/week)
- ADHD-optimized workflow

## Common Issues
- Tab completion in zsh needs tuning
- (Add other recurring issues here)
