Here are the actionable security issues I identified in the @codebase[app] repository, focusing on programming logic problems, configuration issues, and vulnerabilities:

1. **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in `users_controller.rb`**
   - Fix: Implement proper authorization checks in the `show`, `edit`, and `update` actions.

2. **Insufficient Authorization in `admin_controller.rb`**
   - Fix: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict admin actions to authorized users.

3. **Lack of Input Validation in `search_controller.rb`**
   - Fix: Implement strong input validation and sanitization to prevent SQL injection and XSS attacks.

4. **Insecure Password Reset Functionality in `password_resets_controller.rb`**
   - Fix: Implement secure token generation, expiration, and validation for password reset requests.

5. **Insufficient Validation of User-Supplied Data in models**
   - Fix: Implement strong validation rules for user inputs in models.

6. **Missing CSRF Protection in `application_controller.rb`**
   - Fix: Enable CSRF protection by default and add `protect_from_forgery` to the `ApplicationController`.

7. **Insecure Session Storage Configuration in `config/initializers/session_store.rb`**
   - Fix: Configure the session store to use secure cookies and encrypt session data.

8. **Sensitive Data Exposure in `config/database.yml`**
   - Fix: Move sensitive configuration data to environment variables or encrypted credentials.

9. **Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards in `sessions_controller.rb`**
   - Fix: Validate and whitelist redirect URLs to prevent unauthorized redirects.

10. **Insecure Deserialization in `app/models/order.rb`**
    - Fix: Avoid using `Marshal.load` or `YAML.load` on user-supplied data. Use safer alternatives like `JSON.parse`.

11. **Outdated and Vulnerable Dependencies in `Gemfile`**
    - Fix: Update and patch dependencies to the latest secure versions. Use tools like `bundler-audit` to identify vulnerabilities.

12. **Insecure File Uploads in `attachments_controller.rb`**
    - Fix: Validate and sanitize file uploads to prevent malicious file execution and storage.

13. **Insecure Password Hashing in `user.rb`**
    - Fix: Use a secure password hashing algorithm like bcrypt with sufficient work factor.

14. **Insufficient Access Control in `api_controller.rb`**
    - Fix: Implement proper authentication and authorization mechanisms for API endpoints.

These findings focus on specific programming logic problems, configuration issues, and vulnerabilities that introduce real security risks in the @codebase[app] repository. Prioritize and address these issues based on their severity and potential impact on the application's security posture.
