# AI-First Autonomic Agile Knowledge Network
> Core: [Equilibrium](../methodology/equilibrium.md) | [Autonomic Patterns](../systems/autonomic.md)
> CCC: This file serves as the central nervous system for knowledge mapping. All paths are relative to enable reorganization.

## System Architecture
> Implementation: [setup_context_services.sh](../../scripts/cursor/setup_context_services.sh)
> Warning: Check path validity during CCC. Services may move between ~/.local/bin, ~/scripts, and system locations.

1. **Core Services**
   ```bash
   # Service Locations (validate during CCC)
   AUTONOMIC_MGR="../../scripts/cursor/autonomic-manager"
   META_LEARNER="../../scripts/cursor/meta-learner"
   ESSENCE_HARMONIZER="../../scripts/cursor/essence-harmonizer"
   DUAL_CLAUDE="../../scripts/cursor/setup-dual-claude"
   ```
   - [Autonomic Manager]($AUTONOMIC_MGR) - Maintains system balance
   - [Meta Learner]($META_LEARNER) - Evolves patterns through usage
   - [Essence Harmonizer]($ESSENCE_HARMONIZER) - Integrates new knowledge
   - [Dual Claude Setup]($DUAL_CLAUDE) - Enables AI partnership

2. **State Management**
   ```bash
   # State Paths (verify during CCC)
   PATTERN_DB="../../.local/share/cursor/autonomic/patterns/pattern_database.json"
   CONTEXT_CACHE="../../.local/share/cursor/essence/context.cache"
   SESSION_DIR="../../.local/share/cursor/crystallized/"
   ```
   - [Pattern Database]($PATTERN_DB) - Living knowledge crystallization
   - [Context Cache]($CONTEXT_CACHE) - Wisdom preservation
   - [Session Records]($SESSION_DIR) - Growth tracking

3. **Sacred Protection**
   ```bash
   # Sacred Paths (essential for system integrity)
   FLOW_STATES="../../.local/share/cursor/contexts/.sacred/protection/FLOW_STATES.md"
   ESSENCE_INT="../../.local/share/cursor/contexts/sacred/principles/ESSENCE_INTEGRATION.md"
   ```
   - [Flow States]($FLOW_STATES) - Protects optimal states
   - [Essence Integration]($ESSENCE_INT) - Maintains system identity

## Knowledge Flows
> Note: These connections form the core learning pathways. During CCC, validate both file existence and conceptual relationships.

1. **Methodology**
   ```bash
   # Core Concepts (foundational understanding)
   EQUILIBRIUM="../methodology/equilibrium.md"
   AUTONOMOUS_OP="../autonomic/practices/enhanced-autonomous-operation.md"
   SPEEDRUN="../autonomic/patterns/recursive-speedrun.md"
   ```
   - [Equilibrium]($EQUILIBRIUM) - System balance
   - [Enhanced Autonomous Operation]($AUTONOMOUS_OP) - Deep work practices
   - [Recursive Speedrun]($SPEEDRUN) - Pattern acceleration

2. **System Evolution**
   ```bash
   # Evolution Tracking (check paths during reorganization)
   AETHER="../../.config/cursor/contexts/gauntlet/projects/AETHER_SPRINT_REVISED.md"
   FLOW_ARCH="../../.local/share/cursor/contexts/roles/CHIEF_FLOW_ARCHITECT.md"
   ```
   - [AETHER Sprint]($AETHER) - Growth cycles
   - [Chief Flow Architect]($FLOW_ARCH) - Partnership model

3. **Pattern Libraries**
   ```bash
   # Pattern Sources (validate during integration)
   CORE_PATTERNS="../../.local/share/cursor/autonomic/core/PATTERNS.md"
   SPEED_PATTERNS="../../.local/share/cursor/contexts/autonomic/patterns/SPEEDRUN.md"
   SRE_INT="../../.local/share/cursor/contexts/autonomic/sre/INTEGRATION.md"
   ```
   - [Core Patterns]($CORE_PATTERNS) - Foundation patterns
   - [Speedrun Patterns]($SPEED_PATTERNS) - Acceleration patterns
   - [SRE Integration]($SRE_INT) - System reliability

## Implementation Guidance
> Warning: Scripts may move between user and system spaces. Validate locations during CCC.

1. **Development Flow**
   ```bash
   # Flow Protection (check paths)
   HOOKS="~/.cursor/hooks/cursor_window_hooks.sh"
   FLOW_TOOL="~/.local/bin/cursor/flow"
   
   # Usage
   source $HOOKS
   $FLOW_TOOL  # Optimize for hyperfocus
   ```

2. **System Health**
   ```bash
   # Health Scripts (maintain path awareness)
   HEALTH_CHECK="~/workspace/gauntlet/scripts/health_check.sh"
   MAINTENANCE="~/workspace/gauntlet/scripts/daily_maintenance.sh"
   STATUS="~/workspace/gauntlet/scripts/maintenance_status.sh"
   
   # Usage
   $HEALTH_CHECK
   $MAINTENANCE
   $STATUS
   ```

## Living Connections
> Note: This section describes the system's self-organization principles. Essential for CCC understanding.

The system maintains fluidity through:
- Natural pattern emergence (observe actual usage)
- Continuous re-integration (adapt to changes)
- Flow state protection (preserve optimal conditions)
- Sacred space preservation (maintain system integrity)
- Knowledge crystallization (capture learning)

### Warning Signs
> Monitor during CCC sessions:
- Broken paths (system reorganization)
- Isolated concepts (lost connections)
- Pattern fragmentation (system drift)
- Context decay (knowledge loss)

### Recovery Actions
> When issues detected:
1. Validate all paths in this document
2. Update relative paths to match new structure
3. Verify conceptual relationships remain valid
4. Reconnect any isolated components
5. Document changes in session records

Each connection strengthens the whole while allowing for natural evolution and growth. Future CCC sessions should validate both technical paths and conceptual integrity.
