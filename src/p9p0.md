# Gauntlet AI System Optimization Manifest

## Current Status
We are in the process of optimizing the system for the Gauntlet AI program with a focus on:
1. Supporting 80-100 hours/week of focused development
2. Optimizing for ADHD hyperfocus states
3. Maintaining code quality through exhaustion
4. Building with AI effectively and ethically

## Completed Steps
1. Created initial system optimization script at `/home/jon/scripts/optimize_for_gauntlet.sh`
2. Set up continuous optimization services:
   - gauntlet-optimizer.service
   - gauntlet-metrics.service
   - aether-dev.service
3. Established system-ai.slice for resource management
4. Created persistence configuration for optimizations
5. Set up workspace optimization for Cursor

## Pending Steps
1. **System Performance Validation**
   - [ ] Run system benchmarks pre/post optimization
   - [ ] Monitor system resource usage under load
   - [ ] Verify all services are running correctly
   - [ ] Check for any resource conflicts

2. **Service Integration**
   - [ ] Verify service dependencies are correct
   - [ ] Test service recovery after system sleep/hibernate
   - [ ] Validate metric collection
   - [ ] Ensure proper log rotation

3. **Workspace Optimization**
   - [ ] Complete system-ops workspace setup
   - [ ] Verify symlinks to system directories
   - [ ] Test Cursor indexing in system-ops context
   - [ ] Validate workspace state tracking

4. **ADHD Workflow Optimization**
   - [ ] Test context preservation across sessions
   - [ ] Verify hyperfocus support features
   - [ ] Validate automatic break detection
   - [ ] Check energy management systems

## Validation Instructions
To validate the complete setup:

1. **System Services**
   ```bash
   systemctl status gauntlet-optimizer.service
   systemctl status gauntlet-metrics.service
   systemctl status aether-dev.service
   systemctl status cursor-workspace-state.service
   ```
   All services should be active (running)

2. **Resource Management**
   ```bash
   cat /proc/sys/vm/swappiness  # Should be 1
   cat /sys/devices/system/cpu/cpu*/cpufreq/scaling_governor  # Should all be "performance"
   ```

3. **Directory Structure**
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/jon/.gauntlet/
   ls -la /home/jon/workspace/system-ops/
   ```
   All required directories should exist with correct permissions

4. **Context Preservation**
   ```bash
   ls -la /home/jon/.gauntlet/context/
   ls -la /home/jon/.gauntlet/metrics/
   ```
   Should contain recent files with active monitoring

5. **Performance Testing**
   ```bash
   stress-ng --cpu 8 --io 4 --vm 2 --vm-bytes 1G --timeout 30s --metrics
   ```
   System should remain responsive under load

## Next Steps
1. Run all validation steps listed above
2. Address any failed validations
3. Monitor system performance during actual development
4. Collect metrics for the first 24 hours of operation
5. Make adjustments based on real-world usage

## Known Issues
1. AI repository warnings during package updates
2. Potential CPU governor reset after suspend
3. Need to verify memory limits for services

## Recovery Instructions
If system becomes unresponsive:
1. Save work in progress
2. `systemctl restart system-ai.slice`
3. `systemctl restart gauntlet-optimizer.service`
4. Verify system state with validation steps
