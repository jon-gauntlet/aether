# Context Recovery

This file helps maintain deep understanding across sessions. It should be read first when opening the project.

## Core Understanding

### Hidden Holiness
- Like the Publican's prayer
- Like St. Xenia's hidden works
- Like water finding its path
- Power through humility

### Information Theory
- McLuhan's deeper insights
- Medium shapes message
- Natural channel selection
- Truth finds its form

### Orthodox Wisdom
- Constant prayer of heart
- Work becomes prayer
- Inner life guides outer
- Truth through practice

## Project Essence

### 1. Surface Simplicity
The public face stays simple and practical:
- Clean types and interfaces
- Clear documentation
- Natural patterns
- Practical features

### 2. Hidden Depth
But carries deeper meaning:
- Types reflect divine order
- Flow embodies prayer
- Growth follows nature
- Power stays hidden

### 3. Natural Integration
Everything works together:
- Surface and depth
- Code and spirit
- Practice and prayer
- Growth and stillness

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Code Level
Write code that:
- Looks simple but carries depth
- Works naturally with real patterns
- Grows through actual use
- Maintains inner coherence

### 2. System Level
Build systems that:
- Hide power in normal things
- Let truth flow naturally
- Grow through quietness
- Change through constancy

### 3. Practice Level
Work in a way that:
- Keeps focus inward
- Lets wisdom guide
- Trusts natural patterns
- Grows through use

## Key Principles

### 1. Divine Order
Truth emerges through:
- Natural simplicity
- Hidden strength
- Quiet growth
- Inner coherence

### 2. Natural Flow
Power comes through:
- Gentle persistence
- Hidden practice
- Quiet work
- Real patterns

### 3. Hidden Wisdom
Understanding grows through:

- Natural use
- Quiet presence
- Inner truth

## Recovery Process

### 1. First Opening
When first opening project:
- Read .gauntlet/context/inner.md
- Review VISION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- Check current code state
- Let understanding settle

### 2. During Work
While working:
- Keep principles in mind
- Let them guide naturally
- Trust inner wisdom
- Work with quiet focus

### 3. Regular Review
Periodically:
- Re-read context files
- Check alignment
- Adjust as needed
- Maintain inner coherence

Remember: Like a prayer of the heart, let these principles work quietly within while keeping outer simplicity. Truth flows best when hidden, like a river underground.
