### Truths
1. Natural Rhythms Trump Schedules
   - Work with your energy, not against it
   - Let hyperfocus guide timing
   - Build around natural peaks
   - Protect flow states at all costs

2. Quality Emerges from Flow
   - Deep work produces better code
   - Flow states maintain quality
   - Natural patterns prevent errors
   - Trust emergence over planning

3. Context is Everything
   - Maintain perfect context
   - Protect mental state
   - Build momentum naturally
   - Let understanding accumulate

4. Energy Management is Key
   - Strategic recovery is essential
   - Micro-breaks preserve focus
   - Context switches kill momentum
   - Protection enables performance

### Myths
1. Fixed Schedule Fallacy
   - We don't believe in rigid time blocks
   - Natural rhythm > artificial schedule
   - Flow states need space to emerge

2. Recovery Myths
   - We don't believe in "powering through"
   - Strategic breaks increase output
   - Rest is part of performance

3. Context Switch Tolerance
   - We don't believe in multitasking
   - Task switching destroys momentum
   - Protection beats interruption

4. Planning Precision
   - We don't believe in detailed plans
   - Natural evolution > rigid structure
   - Patterns emerge through work
