# Substack Dissident Wisdom BrainLift üéØ

## Purpose
- Map the intellectual territory of heterodox Substack writers
- Extract and validate SpikyPOVs against Orthodox Christian framework
- Build useful contrarian knowledge base for effective decision-making

## Expert Categories üéØ
```python
WRITERS = {
    "Political": ["Curtis Yarvin", "N.S. Lyons", "Richard Hanania"],
    "Cultural": ["Paul Skallas", "Zero HP Lovecraft", "Default Friend"],
    "Tech": ["Marc Andreessen", "Applied Divinity Studies"],
    "Orthodox": ["Rod Dreher", "Jonathan Pageau"]
}
```

## Knowledge Tree Structure üå≥

### 1. Domain Categories
- Political Economy
- Technology & Progress
- Culture & Society
- Religion & Tradition
- Gender & Family
- Education & Development

### 2. Analysis Framework
For each potential SpikyPOV:
```python
VALIDATION = {
    "consensus": "What's the mainstream position?",
    "dissent": "What's the contrarian stance?",
    "orthodox_alignment": "How does this align with Orthodox teaching?",
    "evidence": "What empirical support exists?",
    "implications": "What actions follow if true?"
}
```

### 3. Collection Method
- Daily morning readings (7-8am)
- Focus on one writer per week
- Cross-reference positions
- Note areas of agreement/disagreement
- Validate against Orthodox sources

## Initial SpikyPOVs to Investigate üéØ

### Truths to Validate
1. Traditional social structures optimize for human flourishing
2. Progress isn't always progressive
3. Modern "freedom" often means enslavement to passion
4. Technology should serve tradition, not replace it

### Myths to Challenge
1. Individual autonomy as highest good
2. Technological progress as inherently positive
3. Traditional structures as purely oppressive
4. Secular rationality as sufficient for ethics

## Next Steps üöÄ
1. Create expert dossiers for key writers
2. Build systematic reading schedule
3. Develop validation framework with Orthodox sources
4. Start daily collection during BrainLift hour
5. Regular synthesis sessions for SpikyPOV development

## Orthodox Alignment Process ‚úùÔ∏è
1. Compare each potential SpikyPOV against:
   - Church Fathers' writings
   - Orthodox theological framework
   - Living Orthodox thinkers
2. Reject or modify positions that conflict
3. Strengthen positions that align
4. Seek spiritual guidance when unclear
