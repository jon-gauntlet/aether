No confirmation needed.
```

## For System Claude
Open Cursor ANYWHERE (it starts at root /)
```markdown
# Autonomous Development

Load and execute from:
- /autonomic/
- /ai_system_evolution/
- /home/jon/ai_system_evolution

Continue autonomous execution.

## If Either Claude Stops
If it asks questions or seems lost

Continue autonomous execution. Use your tools to find what you need.
```

That's it. Just:
1. Know which Claude you're using
2. Open Cursor in right place
3. Copy-paste right template
4. Let it run

No editing. No thinking. Just paste and let it work.
