## SpikyPOVs

### Truths
1. Information Architecture Should Mirror Nature
   - Systems should follow natural network topologies, not forced hierarchies
   - Communication patterns should emerge from use, not be prescribed
   - Supported by Barabási's work on scale-free networks
   - Aligns with Kauffman's research on self-organization

2. Context is Continuous, Not Discrete
   - Context should flow naturally with information
   - Understanding builds through natural accumulation
   - Backed by Ted Nelson's hypertext principles
   - Supported by Bret Victor's dynamic representations

3. Medium Shapes Communication
   - System architecture fundamentally influences how people communicate
   - Design should support natural information flow
   - Directly supported by McLuhan's media theory
   - Reinforced by Shannon's information theory

4. Natural Entropy Levels
   - Information seeks its natural organization level
   - Fighting natural information flow creates friction
   - Based on Shannon's entropy principles
   - Validated by Barabási's network formation studies

### Myths
1. Traditional Service Boundaries
   - We don't believe in artificial separation of auth/messaging/media
   - These boundaries fight natural information flow
   - Contradicts traditional client-server architecture

2. Message Atomicity
   - We don't believe in treating messages as discrete units
   - Communication is a continuous flow
   - Challenges conventional message queue patterns

3. Single Consistency Models
   - We don't believe all information needs the same consistency
   - Different types of information want different patterns
   - Questions traditional distributed system assumptions

4. Protocol/UI Separation
   - We don't believe in separating protocol from interface
   - Interface should naturally express information flow
   - Challenges typical layered architecture
