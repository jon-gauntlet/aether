# Context System Paths

## Core Paths
```
└── System Context
    ├── ~/.config/cursor/contexts/     # Core context store
    ├── ~/.context/                    # Extended context
    └── /home/jon/brain/today.md      # Daily notes & active work [READ ONLY]
```

## Usage Patterns

### Daily Notes [/home/jon/brain/today.md] [READ ONLY]
- Source of current context
- Active work tracking
- Daily todos and notes
- Current focus areas
- Work in progress tracking

### Context Integration
- Read daily notes for work patterns
- Observe active development areas
- Learn from progress notes
- Track natural evolution
- Maintain flow awareness

## Remember

The daily notes file is a personal workspace that should NEVER be modified by the assistant - only read to maintain awareness of current work, focus, and progress.
