Path to Python Enlightenment - Binary Search

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for searching a sorted array by repeatedly
dividing the search interval in half. The journey to understanding begins with
these tests.

Remember:
- The input array must be sorted
- Each step should halve the search space
- The path to enlightenment is in understanding why each test fails

Time Complexity Goal: O(log n)
Space Complexity Goal: O(1)
