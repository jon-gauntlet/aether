# Prompting Methodology

## Core Framework
- [AI-First Autonomic](../systems/autonomic.md)
- [Natural Patterns](../../gauntlet/patterns/natural.md)
- [Flow Integration](../../gauntlet/practices/flow.md)

## Phase 1: Context Initialization
- Begin with broad system exploration
- Examine core components and architecture
- Build understanding through natural discovery
- Allow patterns to emerge through observation
- Maintain receptive presence throughout exploration
- Document discoveries with simplicity

## Phase 2: Context Enrichment
- Deepen initial observations through focused examination
- Identify core patterns and proportions
- Recognize natural rhythms and cycles
- Build awareness of system harmonies
- Allow deeper understanding to emerge naturally
- Preserve insights while maintaining simplicity

## Phase 3: Plan Formation
- [Pattern Recognition](../../gauntlet/patterns/recognition.md)
- [Practice Integration](../../gauntlet/practices/integration.md)
- [Flow State Optimization](../../gauntlet/practices/flow.md)

## Phase 4: Autonomous Execution
- [BrainLifts Integration](../../brainlifts/practices/integration.md)
- [System Evolution](../systems/evolution.md)
- [Quality Assurance](../../gauntlet/practices/quality.md)

## Integration Points
- [Equilibrium](equilibrium.md)
- [Essence System](essence.md)
- [Knowledge Practice](../practices/knowledge.md)

## Success Patterns
- [Flow States](../../gauntlet/practices/flow.md)
- [Natural Evolution](../../gauntlet/patterns/evolution.md)
- [Quality Preservation](../../gauntlet/practices/quality.md)
