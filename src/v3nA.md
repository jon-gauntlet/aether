# State Tracking System

## Purpose
This directory maintains state tracking for critical development phases, ensuring continuity between Claude instances and preserving progress against planned objectives.

## Key Files

### `90min_plan_progress.json`
Tracks progress against the 90-minute verification and preparation plan. Structure:

```typescript
{
  plan_created: timestamp      // When the plan was created
  last_updated: timestamp     // Last state update
  phase_state: {             // Status of each phase
    phase1_verification: {...}
    phase2_core_chat: {...}
    phase3_deployment: {...}
  }
  success_metrics: {...}     // Overall success indicators
  risk_events: []           // Any risks encountered
  boundary_violations: []   // Any plan boundary crossings
  notes_for_next_claude: "" // Handoff notes
}
```

## Usage Guidelines

1. **State Updates**
   - Update state after completing each step
   - Mark phases as complete only when fully verified
   - Document any issues in risk_events

2. **Handoff Protocol**
   - Review current state
   - Check boundary_violations
   - Read notes_for_next_claude
   - Continue from last completed phase

3. **Risk Management**
   - Document all encountered issues
   - Note any boundary approaches
   - Preserve system stability
   - Maintain rollback capability

## Success Criteria
- Build system verified
- UI state documented
- Core chat functionality confirmed
- Deployment preparation complete

## Boundaries
- No UI changes
- No feature additions
- No performance optimization
- No edge case handling

Remember: This is a verification and documentation phase. The goal is to understand and document the current state, not to make changes.
