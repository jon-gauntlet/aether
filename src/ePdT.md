# XML Injection Vulnerabilities

## Findings

1. `app/controllers/api/orders_controller.rb`:
   - The `create` action accepts XML input from the user and passes it directly to the `Hash.from_xml` method without proper validation or sanitization:
     ```ruby
     def create
       order_data = Hash.from_xml(request.body.read)
       order = Order.new(order_data['order'])
       if order.save
         render xml: order, status: :created
       else
         render xml: order.errors, status: :unprocessable_entity
       end
     end
     ```
   - This allows attackers to inject arbitrary XML elements and attributes, potentially leading to unintended behavior or security vulnerabilities.
   - To fix this, validate and sanitize the XML input before parsing it, ensuring only expected elements and attributes are allowed. Consider using a more secure XML parsing library or approach.
   - Risk:
     - Likelihood: High (user input is directly passed to the XML parser)
     - Impact: High (potential for XML injection attacks, such as XXE or DoS)

2. `app/views/products/show.xml.builder`:
   - The view template directly interpolates user input into the generated XML output:
     ```ruby
     xml.product do
       xml.name @product.name
       xml.description @product.description
       xml.price number_to_currency(@product.price)
       xml.tags do
         @product.tags.each do |tag|
           xml.tag tag.name
         end
       end
     end
     ```
   - While the impact of this vulnerability is limited to the specific product's data, it still allows for potential XML injection if the product's attributes are not properly validated or sanitized.
   - To mitigate this risk, ensure that all user input is properly escaped or sanitized before being included in the XML output. Consider using built-in view helpers or XML builder methods that automatically escape special characters.
   - Risk:
     - Likelihood: Medium (depends on the validation and sanitization of product attributes)
     - Impact: Medium (limited to the specific product's data)

## Key Takeaways

- Validate and sanitize all user input before parsing or generating XML to prevent XML injection vulnerabilities.
- Use secure XML parsing libraries and techniques, such as disabling external entity resolution and limiting the allowed elements and attributes.
- Escape or sanitize user input when including it in XML output to prevent injection of malicious XML content.
- Regularly review and test code that handles XML input or generates XML output to identify and remediate XML injection vulnerabilities.
- Consider using alternative data formats, such as JSON, which are less susceptible to injection attacks compared to XML.
