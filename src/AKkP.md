- Cover the OWASP Top 10 security risks and any additional risks specific to Rails applications
- Prioritize high-impact vulnerabilities and critical security risks

## Deliverables

- Comprehensive security assessment report
  - Executive summary
  - Assessment methodology
  - Detailed findings with technical details and impact analysis
  - Prioritized recommendations for remediation and risk mitigation
  - Conclusion and next steps
- Complete project folder containing:
