# Core Principles

## Simplicity
The art of maximizing work not done. Choose simpler solutions that reduce cognitive load and maintenance burden.

1. **System Design**
   - Minimize competing configurations
   - Reduce points of failure
   - Choose proven, stable solutions
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Keep dependencies minimal

2. **Cognitive Management**
   - Reduce decision fatigue
   - Clear, predictable patterns
   - Intuitive organization
   - Single source of truth
   - Easy to understand

3. **Implementation**
   - Straightforward solutions first
   - Explicit over implicit
   - Standard patterns preferred
   - Minimal abstraction layers
   - Clear failure modes

4. **Maintenance**
   - Easy to debug
   - Simple to modify
   - Clear upgrade paths
   - Manageable configurations
   - Sustainable long-term

## Focus Preservation
Protect and optimize attention as a critical resource.

1. **Environment**
   - Minimize distractions
   - Optimize for flow
   - Clear work boundaries
   - Stable tooling
   - Predictable behavior

2. **Workflow**
   - Single task focus
   - Clear next actions
   - Minimal context switching
   - Batch similar work
   - Progressive disclosure

## Continuous Optimization
Improve through iteration while maintaining simplicity.

1. **System Health**
   - Regular maintenance
   - Proactive cleanup
   - Performance monitoring
   - Resource optimization
   - Configuration pruning

2. **Knowledge Management**
   - Context crystallization
   - Pattern recognition
   - Essential preservation
   - Clear organization
   - Efficient retrieval

## Integration Guidelines
1. **New Features**
   - Must serve clear purpose
   - Should reduce complexity
   - Integrate naturally
   - Easy to understand
   - Simple to maintain

2. **System Changes**
   - Preserve simplicity
   - Reduce cognitive load
   - Maintain focus
   - Support optimization
   - Clear benefits

3. **Decision Making**
   - Choose simpler options
   - Reduce complexity
   - Favor clarity
   - Enable focus
   - Support maintenance

## Application Areas
