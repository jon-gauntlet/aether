# Assessment Methodology

This security assessment employs a comprehensive methodology encompassing multiple testing categories to evaluate the security posture of the target application. The assessment leverages a combination of automated tools, manual testing techniques, and code analysis to identify vulnerabilities and weaknesses across different layers of the application.

## Testing Categories

The assessment is divided into three main testing categories:

1. **DAST (Dynamic Application Security Testing):**
   - The DAST testing category focuses on identifying vulnerabilities in the running application through automated scanning and manual testing techniques.
   - Tools used in this category include OWASP ZAP with a custom scan policy, Arachni scanner, and manual testing using Burp Suite Community Edition.
   - The findings from DAST testing are stored in the `/findings/dast-manual` directory.

2. **SAST (Static Application Security Testing):**
   - The SAST testing category involves analyzing the application's source code and dependencies for security vulnerabilities and weaknesses.
   - Tools used in this category include dependency scanning tools and static code analysis techniques.
   - The findings from SAST testing are stored in the `/findings/sast-dependency` directory.

3. **Code Analysis:**
   - The code analysis category leverages advanced techniques, such as code generation and language models, to identify security issues and provide recommendations for remediation.
   - The findings from code analysis are stored in the `/findings/code-llm` directory.

## Assessment Workflow

The assessment follows a structured workflow to ensure comprehensive coverage and effective identification of vulnerabilities:

1. **Reconnaissance and Information Gathering:**
   - Gather information about the target application, including its architecture, technologies used, and potential attack surface.
   - Identify key functionalities, input vectors, and critical assets.

2. **Automated Scanning:**
   - Perform automated scanning using tools like OWASP ZAP and Arachni to identify common vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.
   - Customize scan policies and configurations to optimize coverage and reduce false positives.

3. **Manual Testing:**
   - Conduct manual testing to validate findings from automated scans and uncover additional vulnerabilities.
   - Perform in-depth testing of critical functionalities, authentication mechanisms, and business logic flaws.

4. **Code Analysis:**
   - Analyze the application's source code and dependencies using SAST tools and techniques.
   - Leverage code generation and language models to identify security weaknesses and provide remediation guidance.

5. **Data Consolidation and Normalization:**
   - Consolidate findings from different testing categories into a centralized repository.
   - Normalize the data structure and format to ensure consistency and enable effective analysis.

6. **Risk Scoring and Prioritization:**
   - Assign risk scores to identified vulnerabilities based on the OWASP Risk Scoring methodology.
   - Store risk scoring data in a separate MongoDB collection, allowing for independent updates and refinements.
   - Prioritize findings based on their severity, likelihood of exploitation, and potential impact on the application.

7. **Reporting and Remediation:**
   - Generate a comprehensive security assessment report highlighting the identified vulnerabilities, their risk levels, and recommended remediation actions.
   - Provide guidance on best practices and secure coding principles to prevent future vulnerabilities.

## Continuous Improvement

The assessment methodology is continuously refined and updated based on the latest industry standards, emerging threats, and feedback from previous assessments. Regular reviews and retrospectives are conducted to identify areas for improvement and ensure the methodology remains effective in identifying and mitigating security risks.
