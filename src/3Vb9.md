## For Submission (Due 3pm Tomorrow)
Just grab these files:
1. `natural-communication-aether.md` - Main communication system BrainLift
2. `integration-methodology.md` - How BrainLifts work with LLMs

That's it! These are the only files you need to submit. 

## What's Where
- `brainlifts/` (this folder) - Your BrainLifts live here
- `.local/share/aether/` - System stuff (you can ignore)

## System Note
The system will handle copying things to `.local/` automatically. You never need to look there or think about it.
