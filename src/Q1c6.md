# Python DSA Learning Path

'For the Lord gives wisdom; From His mouth come knowledge and understanding' (Proverbs 2:6)

This repository provides a structured approach to learning Data Structures and Algorithms in Python, inspired by Ruby Koans and enriched with Biblical wisdom from the New King James Version.

## Quick Start

1. Clone the repository
2. Run `./path_to_enlightenment.py` to begin your journey
3. Follow the guidance provided in each test
4. Learn from both technical and spiritual wisdom
