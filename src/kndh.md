# Context Management

## Core Principle
Context Management is the art of maintaining clear boundaries and efficient transitions between different operational modes while preserving the integrity and focus of each context.

## Key Aspects

1. **Context Boundaries**
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Distinct operational modes
   - Well-defined transitions
   - Resource isolation

2. **Context Awareness**
   - Environment detection
   - Resource allocation
   - State management
   - Focus preservation

3. **Context Switching**
   - Efficient transitions
   - State preservation
   - Resource reallocation
   - Focus maintenance

## Application

1. **In System Design**
   - Context-aware architecture
   - Resource management
   - State isolation
   - Clean transitions

2. **In Development**
   - Context-based workflows
   - Environment management
   - Resource allocation
   - State preservation

3. **In Operations**
   - Context monitoring
   - Resource tracking
   - State verification
   - Transition management

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Design Phase**
   - Define clear contexts
   - Plan transitions
   - Isolate resources
   - Manage state

2. **Development Phase**
   - Implement boundaries
   - Build transitions
   - Test isolation
   - Verify state

3. **Operational Phase**
   - Monitor contexts
   - Track resources
   - Manage transitions
   - Maintain state

## Principles in Practice

1. **Dual Claude Example**
   - System vs Project contexts
   - Directory-based detection
   - Resource isolation
   - Clean transitions

2. **Resource Management**
   - Context-aware allocation
   - Isolated resources
   - Clean handoffs
   - State preservation

3. **Focus Management**
   - Context preservation
   - Task isolation
   - Clean boundaries
   - Efficient switching

## Remember
- Contexts must be clear
- Transitions must be clean
- Resources must be isolated
- State must be preserved
