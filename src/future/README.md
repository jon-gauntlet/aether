# Future Features Directory

This directory contains features and implementations that are intended for future "turtles" (progressive MVPs) of the Aether project.

## Directory Structure

### ai_features/
Features related to AI capabilities, including:
- RAG system integration
- AI stand-in functionality
- Communication style matching
- Context-aware responses

### advanced_chat/
Advanced chat features beyond basic messaging:
- Rich message formatting
- Advanced channel management
- Complex threading
- Advanced file handling

### docs/
Documentation for future features and their intended use cases.

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Code Preservation**: This directory preserves valuable implementations that aren't needed for the current turtle but will be useful later.

2. **Discovery**: Features here should be well-documented and easily discoverable when needed.

3. **Non-interference**: Code here should not interfere with or complicate the current implementation.

4. **Migration**: When a feature is needed, it can be migrated to the main codebase with minimal refactoring.

## Current Status

The following features are currently stored for future use:
- Document ingestion system (for AI features)
- Advanced message formatting
- Complex channel management

## Integration Points

When these features are needed, they will integrate with:
- Core chat functionality
- Basic channel system
- User authentication
- Message persistence
