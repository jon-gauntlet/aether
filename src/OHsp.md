Here are the updated findings with the risk information included as a final bullet point for each finding:

Findings:

1. `app/controllers/users_controller.rb`:
   - The `show` action uses the `params[:id]` directly in a `find_by_sql` query, which is susceptible to SQL Injection:
     ```ruby
     def show
       @user = User.find_by_sql("SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = '#{params[:id]}'")
     end
     ```
   - To fix this, the action should use Active Record's `find` method instead:
     ```ruby
     def show
       @user = User.find(params[:id])
     end
     ```
   - Risk:
     - Likelihood: High (due to the sensitive nature of user data in a government health and human services application)
     - Impact: High (unauthorized access to user records could lead to severe privacy violations and potential misuse of sensitive information)

2. `app/controllers/search_controller.rb`:
   - The `search` action uses the `params[:query]` in a `where` clause without proper sanitization:
     ```ruby
     def search
       @results = Item.where("name LIKE '%#{params[:query]}%'")
     end
     ```
   - To mitigate the risk of SQL Injection, the action should use Active Record's parameter sanitization:
     ```ruby
     def search
       @results = Item.where("name LIKE ?", "%#{params[:query]}%")
     end
     ```
   - Risk:
     - Likelihood: Medium (while the search functionality is exposed to user input, the impact of exploitation may be limited to information disclosure)
     - Impact: Medium (unauthorized access to search results could reveal sensitive information, but the scope of the impact may be less severe compared to direct access to user records)

3. `app/controllers/admin_controller.rb`:
   - The `update_settings` action uses the `params[:settings]` hash directly in an `update_all` query:
     ```ruby
     def update_settings
       Setting.update_all(params[:settings])
     end
     ```
   - This action is vulnerable to Mass Assignment and potentially SQL Injection if the `params[:settings]` hash is manipulated.
   - To secure this, the action should permit only specific attributes using strong parameters:
     ```ruby
     def update_settings
       permitted_settings = params.require(:settings).permit(:name, :value)
       Setting.update_all(permitted_settings)
     end
     ```
   - Risk:
     - Likelihood: High (admin functionality is a common target for attackers, and the mass assignment vulnerability could allow unauthorized modification of sensitive settings)
     - Impact: High (unauthorized changes to admin settings could compromise the security and integrity of the entire application, potentially affecting all users and data)

Key Takeaways:

- Avoid using user input directly in SQL queries, especially with string interpolation.
- Prefer Active Record query methods like `find`, `where`, and `update_all` over raw SQL.
- Use Active Record's parameter sanitization and strong parameters to protect against injection and mass assignment.
