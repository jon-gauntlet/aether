# Task 2: Authentication and Session Management

## Objective

Identify and document security issues related to Authentication and Session Management in the target application, as defined in the `deliverable/security-assessment-categories.md` file.

## Methodology

1. Review the application's authentication and session management mechanisms, including:
   - User registration and login processes
   - Password policies and storage
   - Session creation, management, and termination
   - Remember me functionality
   - Password reset and account recovery

2. Analyze the implementation of these mechanisms in the application's codebase, focusing on potential vulnerabilities and weaknesses.

3. Refer to industry-standard resources and best practices, such as:
   - OWASP Top 10: A2 - Broken Authentication
   - OWASP Top 10: A5 - Broken Access Control
   - OWASP Authentication Cheat Sheet
   - OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet
   - Rails Security Guide: Authentication
   - Rails Security Guide: Sessions

4. Perform manual testing and code review to identify any authentication and session management flaws, including:
   - Weak or ineffective authentication controls
   - Insecure session management practices
   - Insufficient logout and timeout mechanisms
   - Inadequate protection against brute-force attacks
   - Improper handling of password resets and account recovery

5. Document findings in the `findings/code/02-authentication-session-management` directory, following the established format and structure.

6. Provide recommendations for remediating identified vulnerabilities and improving the application's authentication and session management security.
