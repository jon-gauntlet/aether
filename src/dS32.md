# Security Assessment Methodology

## 1. Objectives
   - Identify and prioritize potential security vulnerabilities in the Rails application
   - Provide clear guidance on verifying and mitigating identified risks
   - Deliver a comprehensive, high-quality security assessment project folder for submission

## 2. Scope
   - Focus on the Rails 7.1 application codebase
   - Cover the security issue categories defined in `notes/security-assessment-categories.md`
   - Prioritize high-impact vulnerabilities and critical security risks

## 3. Approach
   - Follow the "outline speedrunning" methodology (https://learnhowtolearn.org/how-to-build-extremely-quickly/)
     1. Create a recursive outline of the security assessment project
     2. Speedrun the assessment by quickly identifying and documenting potential vulnerabilities
     3. Refine and perfect the assessment findings and recommendations
   - Break down the assessment into manageable tasks and subtasks
   - Utilize frequent breaks, time-boxing techniques, and prayer breaks to maintain focus and productivity
   - Leverage visual aids, code snippets, and examples to enhance understanding and clarity
   - Adapt the assessment process to accommodate your learning style and ADHD considerations
   - Seek guidance and clarification when needed to ensure a comprehensive assessment
   - Prioritize tasks based on their impact on the overall quality of the deliverable
   - Regularly review progress and adjust the approach as needed to ensure timely completion
   - Allocate dedicated time for final review, refinement, and polishing of the project folder
