# Minimal Autonomous Setup

## Core Setup (Remember This)

### 1. Tool Cycle
```
DISCERN (5) → EMERGE (2) → EXECUTE (15) → DOCUMENT (3)
```
Always start here. This is your rhythm.

### 2. Key Numbers
```typescript
const CORE = {
  GOLDEN: 0.618,    // Quality threshold
  SILVER: 0.414,    // Pattern threshold
  BRONZE: 0.302     // Energy threshold
}
```
These guide all decisions.

### 3. Base Prompt
```markdown
# Development Session
Goal: ${clear_goal}
Phase: ${current_phase}
Tools: ${remaining_tools}

## Context
${key_files_and_patterns}

## Instructions
1. Follow the cycle
2. Trust the process

## Quick Start

1. **Initialize**
   ```markdown
   # New Session
   Goal: Clear objective
   Phase: Discern
   Tools: 5
   ```

2. **Execute**
   ```markdown
   Phase: Current phase
   Tools: Remaining count
   Focus: Follow cycle
