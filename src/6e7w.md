# Cursor Context Management System

## Core Principles
1. **Context Preservation**
   - All interactions contribute to knowledge base
   - Context persists across sessions
   - Sacred knowledge is protected
   - Learning is continuous

2. **Self-Improvement**
   - System learns from usage patterns
   - Contexts are automatically optimized
   - Knowledge gaps are identified and filled
   - Redundancy is eliminated

3. **Gauntlet Success**
   - All actions align with winning
   - Knowledge serves development
   - Context supports focus
   - System adapts to needs

## System Architecture
1. **Directory Structure**
   ```
   ~/.config/cursor/
   ├── contexts/
   │   ├── system/    # System-wide context
   │   ├── general/   # General knowledge
   │   ├── projects/  # Project-specific
   │   └── sacred/    # Protected knowledge
   └── state/
       └── active_contexts
   ```

2. **Services**
   - cursor-semantic-indexer
   - cursor-context-optimizer
   - cursor-context-bridge

3. **Optimization Cycle**
   - Index → Analyze → Optimize → Bridge
   - Continuous improvement
   - Self-healing
   - Pattern learning

## Usage Patterns
1. **Context Loading**
   - Automatic per session
   - Project-aware
   - Priority-based
   - Depth-sensitive

2. **Knowledge Integration**
   - Real-time updates
   - Cross-referencing
   - Pattern matching
   - Gap detection

3. **Sacred Handling**
   - Protected access
   - Integrity checks
   - Version control
   - Secure storage

## System Goals
1. **Primary**
   - Win the Gauntlet
   - Support development
   - Preserve knowledge
   - Enable focus

2. **Operational**
   - Minimize overhead
   - Maximize utility
   - Ensure reliability
   - Support growth

3. **Learning**
   - Identify patterns
   - Adapt to needs
   - Fill gaps
   - Optimize access
