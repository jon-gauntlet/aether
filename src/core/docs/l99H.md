## Key Recommendations for Secure User Management in @codebase[app]
Based on [Section 5 - User Management](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#user-management) of the Rails Security Guide.

1. Review the authentication system used in the application. If a custom authentication solution is used, consider replacing it with a well-tested and secure authentication library like Devise or Clearance. If Devise is already used (as indicated by the presence of `devise` in the `Gemfile`), ensure it is up to date and properly configured.

2. Audit the `app/models/user.rb` file to ensure that user passwords are securely hashed and salted before storing them in the database. If Devise is used, verify that the `devise` configuration in `config/initializers/devise.rb` is set to use a secure hashing algorithm like bcrypt with a sufficient work factor.

3. Implement proper password complexity requirements in the `app/models/user.rb` file or the Devise configuration. Enforce a minimum password length, require the use of different character types, and prevent the use of common words or phrases.

4. Review the password reset functionality in the application. Ensure that the password reset link is a time-limited, single-use token sent to the user's verified email address. If Devise is used, review the `config/initializers/devise.rb` file to ensure that the `reset_password_within` option is set to a reasonable time limit.

5. Implement account locking after a certain number of failed login attempts to prevent brute-force attacks. This can be done in the `app/models/user.rb` file or using Devise's `lockable` module. Consider using exponential backoff for failed attempts to further deter attackers.

6. Review the user registration process and ensure that user-supplied data, such as names or email addresses, are properly validated and sanitized to prevent XSS and injection attacks. Implement server-side validation in the `app/models/user.rb` file or the corresponding controller actions.

7. If the application allows users to upload profile pictures or other files, ensure that the uploaded files are properly validated and stored securely. Implement file type and size restrictions, and consider using a third-party storage service like Amazon S3 to store user-uploaded files instead of the local filesystem.
