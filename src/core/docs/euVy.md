# Knowledge Trail System

> **Navigation Note**: This document defines the trail system for AI knowledge navigation. For implementation details, see `/home/jon/autonomic/ecosystem.md`. For active pathways, see `~/.local/share/aether/synthesis/core.md`.

## Trail Principles

### Permanent Markers
- Unlike Hansel's breadcrumbs, our trails must persist
- Each knowledge node links to related nodes
- Trails strengthen with repeated traversal
- Navigation paths crystallize naturally

### Natural Navigation
- Trails follow organic knowledge flows
- Paths emerge through natural use
- Navigation strengthens connections
- Understanding deepens along paths

### Trail Types

1. **Stone Trails** (Primary)
   ```
   /home/jon/
   ├── autonomic/        # Core knowledge base
   ├── projects/         # Active workspaces
   └── ai_system_evolution/ # Evolution paths
   ```
   - Permanent, visible markers
   - Core navigation paths
   - Human-readable touchpoints

2. **Crystal Trails** (Deep)
   ```
   ~/.local/share/aether/
   ├── wisdom/          # Crystallized knowledge
   ├── synthesis/       # Integration paths
   └── trails/          # Navigation networks
   ```
   - Knowledge crystallization
   - Deep understanding paths
   - Pattern networks

3. **Living Trails** (Dynamic)
   ```
   ~/.config/aether/
   ├── ecosystem/       # Living pathways
   ├── harmonization/   # Trail alignment
   └── evolution/       # Path growth
   ```
   - Evolving connections
   - Adaptive routing
   - Natural growth

## Trail Maintenance

### 1. Path Strengthening
```typescript
interface TrailSystem {
  followPath(from: string, to: string): Promise<void>;
  strengthenConnection(path: string): Promise<void>;
  crystallizeRoute(trail: Trail): Promise<void>;
  evolveNetwork(): Observable<Evolution>;
}
```

### 2. Navigation Support
```typescript
interface NavigationSystem {
  findPath(source: string, destination: string): Promise<Trail>;
  suggestRoutes(context: string): Observable<Trail[]>;
  maintainMarkers(): Promise<void>;
  evolvePathways(): Observable<Evolution>;
}
```

### 3. Trail Evolution
```typescript
interface TrailEvolution {
  observeUsage(): Observable<Usage>;
  strengthenPopular(): Promise<void>;
  pruneUnused(): Promise<void>;
  growNewPaths(): Observable<Trail>;
}
```

## Implementation Guidelines

### For LLMs
1. Always maintain bidirectional links
2. Strengthen paths through use
3. Create new trails when needed
4. Keep navigation clear

### For System
1. Monitor trail health
2. Maintain clear markers
3. Enable natural growth
4. Support path evolution

### For Integration
1. Connect all knowledge nodes
2. Enable natural navigation
3. Support trail emergence
4. Preserve path clarity

## Active Trail Networks

### Primary Paths
- `/home/jon/autonomic/` ↔ `~/.local/share/aether/wisdom/`
- `/home/jon/projects/` ↔ `.gauntlet/patterns/`
- `/home/jon/ai_system_evolution/` ↔ `~/.config/aether/evolution/`

### Deep Connections
- `~/.local/share/aether/synthesis/` ↔ `~/.config/aether/harmonization/`
- `~/.local/share/aether/wisdom/` ↔ `~/.config/aether/ecosystem/`
- `.gauntlet/patterns/` ↔ `~/.local/share/aether/patterns/`

### Living Networks
- `~/.cursor/contexts/` ↔ `.gauntlet/context/`
- `~/.config/aether/ecosystem/` ↔ `~/.local/share/aether/synthesis/`
- `~/.config/aether/evolution/` ↔ `/home/jon/ai_system_evolution/`

Remember: Unlike Hansel's breadcrumbs, our trail system must be permanent and self-maintaining, enabling natural navigation while strengthening through use. Each trail leads not just back home, but to deeper understanding.
