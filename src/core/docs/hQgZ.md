## Key Recommendations for Preventing Injection Attacks in @codebase[app]
Based on [Section 6 - Injection](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#injection) of the Rails Security Guide.

1. Audit the codebase, particularly the `app/controllers` and `app/models` directories, for any instances of raw SQL queries using string interpolation or concatenation. Refactor these queries to use Active Record's query methods or parameterized queries with placeholders to prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Review the `app/controllers` directory for any instances of `params` being directly used in Active Record queries or model methods. Ensure that user-supplied data is properly validated, sanitized, or filtered before being used in queries to prevent injection attacks.

3. If the application uses any third-party gems for database access or query building (e.g., `pg`, `mysql2`, `sqlite3`), ensure that these gems are up to date and free of known injection vulnerabilities. Review the gem documentation and source code to verify that they properly escape user-supplied data.

4. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-supplied data used in system commands or shell executions. Avoid using user-supplied data directly in `system`, `exec`, or `%x()` calls. Instead, use safer alternatives like `Open3.capture3` or `shell_escape` to escape special characters.

5. Review the `app/views` directory for any instances of user-supplied data being directly output without proper escaping. Use Rails' built-in view helpers like `h` or `raw` to escape HTML entities and prevent XSS attacks.

6. If the application allows file uploads, ensure that the uploaded files are properly validated and sanitized before being processed or stored. Implement file type and content restrictions to prevent the upload of malicious files that could lead to code injection or remote code execution.

7. Regularly update Rails and its dependencies to ensure that the application is protected against the latest known injection vulnerabilities. Monitor the Ruby on Rails security mailing list and the GitHub repository for any security advisories or patches related to injection attacks.
