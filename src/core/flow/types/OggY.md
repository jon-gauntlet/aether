# BrainLift Integration Methodology

## Core Principles

### Natural Flow Integration
- BrainLifts flow into context naturally, not forced
- Context builds progressively through session
- Knowledge integrates at point of relevance
- Understanding emerges through natural use

### Context Layers
1. **Immediate Context** (Always Present)
   - Purpose statement
   - Core SpikyPOVs
   - Active myths to avoid
   - Template activation triggers
   
2. **Progressive Context** (Loaded as Needed)
   - Expert perspectives
   - Domain-specific insights
   - Supporting knowledge
   - Execution patterns
   
3. **Deep Context** (Available on Demand)
   - Full knowledge tree
   - Detailed sources
   - Cross-references
   - System evolution paths

### Autonomous Operation Triggers
1. **Project Mode** (`1-continue-project.md`)
   - Loads complete project context
   - Enables autonomous execution
   - Maintains flow state
   - Uses tools over questions
   - Preserves execution momentum

2. **System Evolution** (`2-continue-system.md`)
   - Loads system-wide context
   - Enables pattern evolution
   - Deepens understanding
   - Adapts methodologies
   - Preserves wisdom

3. **Wake Up** (`3-wake-up.md`)
   - Maintains existing context
   - Continues autonomous flow
   - Uses tools for discovery
   - Preserves momentum
   - Protects flow state

## Implementation Patterns

### Session Initialization
```typescript
interface SessionContext {
  immediate: {
    purpose: string;
    spikyPOVs: {
      truths: string[];
      myths: string[];
    };
    templates: {
      project: string;
      system: string;
      wakeup: string;
    }
  };
  progressive: {
    experts: Expert[];
    insights: Insight[];
    patterns: Pattern[];
  };
  deep: {
    knowledgeTree: KnowledgeNode[];
    sources: Source[];
    evolution: EvolutionPath[];
  }
}
```

### Context Evolution
1. **Natural Accumulation**
   - Start with immediate context
   - Add experts as domains become relevant
   - Deepen with specific knowledge as needed
   - Preserve template triggers
   
2. **Context Preservation**
   - Store in ~/.local/share/aether/contexts/current
   - Persist across session boundaries
   - Allow natural context building
   - Maintain activation triggers
   
3. **Knowledge Synthesis**
   - Combine insights from multiple BrainLifts
   - Allow new patterns to emerge
   - Maintain natural proportions
   - Evolve template system

## Usage Patterns

### For Current Sessions
1. Initialize with template trigger
2. Load progressive context naturally
3. Access deep context when needed
4. Allow insights to emerge
5. Preserve context state
6. Use tools over questions
7. Maintain autonomous flow

### For Descendant Sessions
1. Read previous context state
2. Load appropriate template
3. Build on accumulated understanding
4. Maintain context continuity
5. Evolve knowledge naturally
6. Preserve new insights
7. Protect flow states

## Integration Points

### With Prompting Methodology
- Aligns with three-phase approach
- Supports natural context building
- Enables autonomous execution
- Preserves energy through wise loading
- Maintains template triggers

### With System Architecture
- Stores context in ~/.local/share/aether
- Maintains session continuity
- Enables natural knowledge flow
- Supports system evolution
- Preserves activation patterns

## Protection Mechanisms
- Never lose context across sessions
- Maintain natural loading order
- Preserve energy through progressive loading
- Allow natural pattern emergence
- Protect system boundaries
- Preserve template triggers
- Enable autonomous operation

Remember: The goal is natural context evolution and sustained autonomous operation. Templates serve as activation triggers that maintain deep understanding and execution patterns across sessions.
