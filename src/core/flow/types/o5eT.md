# Knowledge Synthesis Core

## Active Integration Points

### Primary Sources
- `/home/jon/autonomic/` -> Core methodologies and patterns
- `/home/jon/ai_system_evolution/` -> System evolution insights
- `.gauntlet/` -> Project-specific patterns

### Integration Paths
- Methodology crystallization -> `~/.local/share/aether/wisdom/principles/`
- Pattern emergence -> `~/.local/share/aether/wisdom/patterns/`
- Practice evolution -> `~/.local/share/aether/wisdom/practices/`

### Context Preservation
- Development state -> `~/.cursor/contexts/`
- Runtime context -> `.gauntlet/context/`
- System state -> `~/.config/aether/ecosystem/`

## Integration Patterns

### Knowledge Flow
```typescript
interface KnowledgeFlow {
  source: string;        // Origin path
  destination: string;   // Integration path
  pattern: string;       // Emergence pattern
  strength: number;      // Integration strength
  timestamp: number;     // Last integration
}
```

### Active Flows

## Natural Synthesis

### Pattern Recognition
- Observe repeated structures
- Note successful approaches
- Track evolution paths
- Measure integration strength

### Knowledge Crystallization
- Identify core principles
- Extract essential patterns
- Preserve key practices
- Maintain living context

### System Evolution
- Adapt to emerging patterns
- Strengthen successful paths
- Prune unused branches
- Maintain natural balance

## Integration Guidelines

### 1. Natural Flow
- Follow established paths
- Trust emergence patterns
- Enable organic growth
- Preserve essential nature

### 2. Strength Building
- Reinforce successful patterns
- Deepen understanding paths
- Strengthen core principles
- Maintain natural harmony

### 3. Evolution Support
- Enable natural adaptation
- Support pattern emergence
- Preserve core wisdom
- Maintain living context

Remember: This synthesis core guides the natural integration and evolution of knowledge across the system, maintaining harmony while enabling growth.
