## Key Recommendations for Implementing HTTP Security Headers in @codebase[app]
Based on [Section 8 - HTTP Security Headers](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#http-security-headers) of the Rails Security Guide.

1. Enable the `default_headers` middleware in the application's configuration file (`config/application.rb`) to automatically set secure default headers for all responses. Customize the headers based on the application's specific security requirements.

2. Set the `X-Frame-Options` header to `SAMEORIGIN` or `DENY` to protect against clickjacking attacks. If the application requires framing from a specific domain, use the `ALLOW-FROM` directive with the trusted domain.

3. Enable the `X-XSS-Protection` header with the value `1; mode=block` to instruct browsers to block suspected XSS attacks. This header provides an additional layer of protection against XSS attacks.

4. Set the `X-Content-Type-Options` header to `nosniff` to prevent browsers from inferring the MIME type of a response. This header helps protect against MIME type confusion attacks.

5. Enable the `Strict-Transport-Security` (HSTS) header to enforce HTTPS connections and prevent downgrade attacks. Set the `max-age` directive to a sufficient value (e.g., 31536000 seconds for one year) and consider including the `includeSubDomains` directive if applicable.

6. Implement a Content Security Policy (CSP) by setting the `Content-Security-Policy` header. Define a strict policy that allows loading resources only from trusted sources and restricts potentially dangerous inline scripts and styles. Use the `rails-csp` gem to manage the CSP configuration more easily.

7. Regularly review and update the implemented security headers to ensure they align with the latest best practices and security standards. Keep an eye out for new headers or directives that can further enhance the application's security posture.
