# Gauntlet AI System Evolution

An autonomous system for evolving and optimizing AI development patterns while maintaining system integrity and accessibility.

## Core Features

- **Pattern Learning**: Learns patterns from system behavior and development activities
- **Pattern Synthesis**: Synthesizes higher-level patterns through clustering and analysis
- **Autonomic Management**: Self-monitoring and optimization while preserving system stability
- **Resource Protection**: Built-in safeguards for Cursor and Arch Linux system resources
- **Context Awareness**: Maintains awareness of system state and development contexts

## Architecture

The system consists of several key components:

- **Context Manager**: Tracks and manages system contexts
- **Pattern Learner**: Learns patterns from observed behaviors
- **Pattern Synthesizer**: Combines and evolves learned patterns
- **Autonomic Manager**: Orchestrates the overall system evolution

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai_system_evolution.git
cd ai_system_evolution
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Install the systemd service:
```bash
sudo cp systemd/gauntlet-autonomic.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable gauntlet-autonomic
sudo systemctl start gauntlet-autonomic
```

## Configuration

The system can be configured through several configuration classes:

- `AutonomicConfig`: Controls autonomic management parameters
- `LearnerConfig`: Controls pattern learning behavior
- `SynthesizerConfig`: Controls pattern synthesis parameters
- `ContextConfig`: Controls context management settings

Configuration files are stored in `~/.config/gauntlet/`.

## Usage

The system runs autonomously as a systemd service, but can also be run manually:

```bash
python -m lib.autonomic.manager
```

Monitor the service status:
```bash
systemctl status gauntlet-autonomic
```

View logs:
```bash
journalctl -u gauntlet-autonomic
```

## Development

1. Set up the development environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run tests:
```bash
pytest tests/
```

3. Format code:
```bash
black .
isort .
```

4. Run type checking:
```bash
mypy .
```

## Protection Directives

The system includes built-in protection for critical resources:

- Cursor IDE and related processes
- Arch Linux system stability
- User login and accessibility
- System resource availability

These protections are enforced through:

- Resource limits in systemd service
- Protected paths and processes
- Minimum resource thresholds
- Emergency recovery procedures
