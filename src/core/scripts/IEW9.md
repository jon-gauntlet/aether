# Applying Rails Security Guide Recommendations to @codebase[app]

This document provides a summary of how to apply the Key Recommendations from the Rails Security Guide to the @codebase[app] application. Each recommendation includes a brief explanation of its relevance and actionable steps to implement it.

## 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

1. **Ensure `protect_from_forgery` is enabled in `ApplicationController`** (Section 3)
   - Check the `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file and verify that the `protect_from_forgery` method is called.
   - If missing, add `protect_from_forgery with: :exception` to the `ApplicationController` class.

2. **Audit controllers for `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token`** (Section 3)
   - Search the `app/controllers` directory for any instances of `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token`.
   - For each occurrence, assess whether skipping CSRF protection is necessary and safe for that action.
   - If the action doesn't require session access, replace the skip with `protect_from_forgery with: :null_session`.

3. **Ensure CSRF token is included in all forms and AJAX requests** (Section 3)
   - Review the `app/views` directory and check that all forms include the `csrf_meta_tags` helper in their layout.
   - For AJAX requests, ensure the `X-CSRF-Token` header is set with the CSRF token value.

## 2. Session Management

1. **Configure session store with a unique, random `session_key`** (Section 2)
   - Open the `config/initializers/session_store.rb` file and verify that the `session_key` option is set to a unique, random value.
   - If missing or using a default value, generate a new random `session_key` and update the configuration.

2. **Set `config.force_ssl = true` in production environment** (Section 2)
   - Open the `config/environments/production.rb` file and ensure that `config.force_ssl = true` is set.
   - This enforces HTTPS for all requests, protecting session data in transit.

3. **Implement session timeout mechanism** (Section 2)
   - In the `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file, add a `before_action` to check for session timeout.
   - Compare the current timestamp with the last activity timestamp stored in the session.
   - If the idle time exceeds the desired timeout duration, invalidate the session and redirect the user to the login page.

## 3. User Management

1. **Use a secure authentication library like Devise** (Section 5)
   - If the application uses a custom authentication system, consider replacing it with a well-tested library like Devise.
   - Follow the Devise installation and configuration instructions to set up secure user authentication.

2. **Implement password complexity requirements** (Section 5)
   - In the `app/models/user.rb` file, add validations for password complexity.
   - Require a minimum length, a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Use a library like `devise-security` to enhance password security features.

3. **Implement account locking after failed login attempts** (Section 5)
   - In the `app/models/user.rb` file, add a mechanism to lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
   - Use Devise's `lockable` module or implement a custom solution to track failed attempts and lock accounts.

## 4. Injection Prevention

1. **Refactor raw SQL queries to use Active Record methods** (Section 6)
   - Search the `app/controllers` and `app/models` directories for any instances of raw SQL queries using string interpolation or concatenation.
   - Replace these queries with Active Record's query methods or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

2. **Validate and sanitize user input before using in queries** (Section 6)
   - Review the `app/controllers` directory for any instances of user input being directly used in Active Record queries or model methods.
   - Implement strong parameter filtering and validation to ensure only permitted and sanitized data is used in queries.

3. **Escape user input when outputting to views** (Section 6)
   - In the `app/views` directory, locate any instances of user-supplied data being directly output without proper escaping.
   - Use Rails' built-in view helpers like `h` or `raw` to escape HTML entities and prevent XSS attacks.

## 5. HTTP Security Headers

1. **Enable default security headers using `default_headers`** (Section 8)
   - Open the `config/application.rb` file and uncomment or add the `config.action_dispatch.default_headers` configuration.
   - Set appropriate values for headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security`.

2. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** (Section 8)
   - In the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` file, define a strict CSP that allows loading resources only from trusted sources.
   - Use the `rails-csp` gem to manage the CSP configuration more easily.
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure the CSP doesn't break legitimate functionality.

## 6. Intranet and Admin Security

1. **Implement strong authentication and authorization for admin interfaces** (Section 9)
   - Review the admin interface controllers and ensure they use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Use a library like Devise or Pundit to handle admin user authentication and role-based access control.

2. **Restrict access to admin interfaces by IP or VPN** (Section 9)
   - Implement network-level access controls to limit access to the admin interfaces.
   - Use IP whitelisting or require admin users to connect through a secure VPN.

3. **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users** (Section 9)
   - Implement MFA for admin user accounts to add an extra layer of security.
   - Use libraries like `devise-two-factor` or `two_factor_authentication` to enable MFA.

## 7. Environmental Security

1. **Use environment variables for sensitive configuration** (Section 10)
   - Review the `config` directory and ensure sensitive information like database credentials and secret keys are not hardcoded.
   - Move sensitive configuration to environment variables or use encrypted credential storage mechanisms provided by Rails.

2. **Implement secure backup and recovery processes** (Section 10)
   - Establish a secure backup and recovery process for the application's data and configurations.
   - Ensure backups are encrypted, stored securely, and regularly tested for integrity and recoverability.

## 8. Dependency Management

1. **Regularly update and patch dependencies** (Section 11)
   - Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `brakeman` to scan the `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities.
   - Update the application's dependencies, including Rails, Ruby, and third-party gems, to the latest stable and secure versions.

2. **Implement a dependency management process** (Section 11)
   - Establish a process to monitor for new releases, security patches, and CVEs related to the application's dependencies.
   - Subscribe to security mailing lists and keep an eye on the GitHub repositories of the dependencies for any security announcements.

3. **Integrate dependency auditing into CI/CD pipeline** (Section 11)
   - Set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that includes automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checking.
   - Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `brakeman` in the CI/CD process to identify and alert on any security issues introduced by dependency updates.

By following these actionable steps and implementing the relevant recommendations from the Rails Security Guide, you can significantly enhance the security posture of the @codebase[app] application. Remember to regularly review and update these security measures to stay ahead of emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
