# Aether - Flow State Optimization System

A React TypeScript application designed to optimize development workflow through energy and flow state management.

## Core Features

### Energy Management
- Track and optimize mental, physical, emotional, and creative energy
- Flow state detection and enhancement
- Automatic energy decay and recovery mechanisms
- Visual energy state indicators

### Pattern Recognition
- Development pattern identification
- Pattern-based optimization suggestions
- Learning accumulation tracking
- Interactive pattern activation

### Autonomic Development
- Task-specific energy management
- Flow state optimization
- Pattern-guided development
- Performance metrics tracking

## Project Goals
1. Support 80-100 hours/week of focused development
2. Optimize for ADHD hyperfocus states
3. Maintain code quality through exhaustion
4. Build with AI effectively and ethically
5. Win the Gauntlet through sustained excellence

## Architecture

### Core Systems
1. **Energy System**
   - Energy type management (mental, physical, emotional)
   - Flow state tracking and transitions
   - Recovery mechanisms and optimization
   - Performance metrics and monitoring

2. **Pattern System**
   - Development pattern recognition
   - Pattern visualization and activation
   - Confidence-based pattern matching
   - Interactive pattern management

3. **Autonomic System**
   - State management integration
   - Performance monitoring
   - Adaptive development flow
   - Energy-aware execution

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Component communication
   - State synchronization
   - Event handling
   - System coordination

## Type Safety
The project uses strict TypeScript configuration. All files should:
- Have explicit type annotations
- Avoid using `any`
- Maintain proper interface definitions
- Follow the type-safe patterns in core modules
