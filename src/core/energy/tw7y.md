2. Key Components:
   - Energy Types (Mental, Physical, Emotional)
   - Flow States (Focus, Flow, Hyperfocus, Recovering, Exhausted, Distracted)
   - Energy Metrics (Efficiency, Sustainability, Recovery)
   - Prediction System for Energy Needs

### Pattern System
1. Found core Pattern System implementation:
   - RxJS-based pattern management
   - Pattern matching and evolution
   - Learning history tracking
   - Context-aware pattern application

2. Key Components:
   - Pattern States (Active, Stable, Evolving, Protected)
   - Learning Records with Context/Energy/Flow data
   - Pattern Matching Algorithm
   - Pattern Evolution System

### Test Coverage
1. Found Context System Tests:
   - Comprehensive test suite for Context management
   - Initialization, content management, metadata handling
   - Type management and observation tests
   - Error handling coverage

2. Found Pattern System Tests:
   - React component tests for PersistentPatternGuided
   - Pattern evolution and state management tests
   - Import/export functionality coverage
   - Error handling and edge cases
