# Recovery Status Update

## Latest Findings

### Energy System
1. Found two versions of `useEnergy` hook in Cursor history:
   - Version 1: Simple energy model with flow state transitions
   - Version 2: Advanced energy model with mental/physical/emotional tracking

2. Key Components:
   - Energy Types (Mental, Physical, Emotional)
   - Flow States (Focus, Flow, Hyperfocus, Recovering, Exhausted, Distracted)
   - Energy Metrics (Efficiency, Sustainability, Recovery)
   - Prediction System for Energy Needs

## Recovery Priorities

1. **Core Systems**
   - [x] Energy System (Partially Recovered)
   - [x] Autonomic System (Partially Recovered)
   - [ ] Pattern System (In Progress)
   - [ ] Flow State Management
   - [ ] Test Coverage

2. **Integration Layer**
   - [ ] React Components
   - [ ] State Management
   - [ ] Event System
   - [ ] Metrics Collection

3. **Recovery Tasks**
   - [ ] Merge best features from both useEnergy versions
   - [ ] Restore test files for Energy system
   - [ ] Implement missing Flow State transitions
   - [ ] Rebuild integration with Autonomic system

## Next Steps

1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Create unified Energy system from recovered versions
   - Restore test coverage for core functionality
   - Document system interactions and dependencies

2. **System Completion**
   - Implement remaining core systems
   - Restore integration layers
   - Rebuild monitoring and metrics

3. **Protection Measures**
   - Regular git commits
   - Automated backups
   - System state snapshots
   - Recovery verification tests

## Current System State

1. **Energy System**
   - Core hook implementation recovered
   - Multiple versions with different features
   - Missing test coverage
   - Integration points unclear

2. **Autonomic System**
   - Basic implementation recovered
   - Pattern recognition partial
   - Validation systems present
   - Missing integration tests

## Recovery Metrics

1. **Files Recovered**
   - Core System Files: 2/5
   - Test Files: 0/5
   - Integration Files: 0/3

2. **Functionality**
   - Energy System: 60%
   - Autonomic System: 40%
   - Pattern System: 20%
   - Overall: ~40%

## Immediate Focus

1. **Code Recovery**
   - Continue searching Cursor history for related files
   - Rebuild test files from recovered implementations
   - Document all recovered functionality

2. **System Integration**
   - Map dependencies between recovered systems
   - Identify missing integration points
   - Prioritize critical path recovery

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain updated recovery status
   - Document system architecture
   - Track recovery metrics
