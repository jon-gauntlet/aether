# Recovery Status Update

## Latest Findings

### Energy System
1. Found two versions of `useEnergy` hook in Cursor history:
   - Version 1: Simple energy model with flow state transitions
   - Version 2: Advanced energy model with mental/physical/emotional tracking

2. Key Components:
   - Energy Types (Mental, Physical, Emotional)
   - Flow States (Focus, Flow, Hyperfocus, Recovering, Exhausted, Distracted)
   - Energy Metrics (Efficiency, Sustainability, Recovery)
   - Prediction System for Energy Needs

### Pattern System
1. Found core Pattern System implementation:
   - RxJS-based pattern management
   - Pattern matching and evolution
   - Learning history tracking
   - Context-aware pattern application

2. Key Components:
   - Pattern States (Active, Stable, Evolving, Protected)
   - Learning Records with Context/Energy/Flow data
   - Pattern Matching Algorithm
   - Pattern Evolution System
