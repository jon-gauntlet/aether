# Aether Project Recovery Documentation

## Recovery Status
- **Date**: Current
- **Status**: In Progress
- **Recovered Files**:
  - `src/core/energy/types.ts`
  - `src/core/energy/useEnergy.ts`
  - `src/components/AutonomicDevelopment.tsx`
  - `src/components/EnergyAware.tsx`
  - `src/components/PatternGuided.tsx`
  - `package.json`
  - `tsconfig.json`

## Project Structure
The project is a React TypeScript application focused on optimizing development workflow through energy and flow state management. Key components include:

### Core Systems
1. **Energy Management**
   - Types: `EnergyType`, `FlowState`, `Energy`, `EnergyMeta`
   - Hook: `useEnergy` for managing energy states
   - Constants: Energy decay, flow bonus, and recovery rates

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   - Component: `PatternGuided` for identifying development patterns
   - Features: Pattern activation, state tracking
   - UI: Interactive pattern selection and status display

3. **Autonomic Development**
   - Component: `AutonomicDevelopment` integrating energy and patterns
   - Features: Task tracking, energy monitoring, pattern guidance
   - UI: Energy levels, flow state, pattern counts

4. **Energy Awareness**
   - Component: `EnergyAware` for energy-based UI adaptation
   - Features: Visual energy indicators, flow state display
   - UI: Dynamic styling based on energy levels

## Recovery Process

### 1. Initial Assessment
- Project identified as React TypeScript application
- Core files found in Cursor editor history
- Basic project structure determined from file imports

### 2. File Recovery
- Core type definitions restored
- React components reconstructed
- Project configuration files recreated

### 3. Dependencies
- Package.json recreated with necessary dependencies
- TypeScript configuration restored
- Dependencies installed via npm

### 4. Current Issues
1. **Linter Errors**:
   - React type declarations missing
   - Styled-components type declarations missing
   - Implicit any types in callbacks
   - JSX element type issues

### 5. Next Steps
1. **Fix Type Issues**:
   - Add proper type annotations to callbacks
   - Fix implicit any types in component props
   - Ensure proper React type imports

2. **Missing Files to Recover**:
   - Application entry point (`src/index.tsx`)
   - Main App component (`src/App.tsx`)
   - Additional core system files from history
   - Style files and themes
   - Test files

3. **Project Setup**:
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Set up development environment
   - Configure build process
   - Add documentation

## Recovery Sources
1. Cursor Editor History
   - Location: `/home/jon/.config/Cursor/User/History/`
   - Contains TypeScript file versions
   - Preserves component structure and logic

2. Project Files
   - Core type definitions
   - Component implementations
   - Configuration files

## Backup Recommendations
1. **Version Control**
   - Initialize Git repository
   - Set up remote backup
   - Regular commits and pushes

2. **Local Backups**
   - Regular filesystem backups
   - Editor history preservation
   - Configuration backups

3. **Documentation**
   - Maintain architecture documentation
   - Update recovery procedures
   - Document system dependencies

## Project Goals (from recovered files)
1. Support 80-100 hours/week of focused development
2. Optimize for ADHD hyperfocus states
3. Maintain code quality through exhaustion
4. Build with AI effectively and ethically
5. Win the Gauntlet through sustained excellence

## System Components
1. **Energy System**
   - Energy type management
   - Flow state tracking
   - Recovery mechanisms
   - Performance optimization

2. **Pattern System**
   - Development pattern recognition
   - Pattern activation tracking
   - Learning accumulation
   - Optimization suggestions

3. **Autonomic System**
   - State management integration
   - Performance monitoring
   - Adaptive development flow
   - Energy-aware execution

4. **Integration Layer**
   - Component communication
   - State synchronization
   - Event handling
   - System coordination

## Recovery Priorities
1. Core system functionality
2. Type safety and linting
3. Component integration
4. Testing infrastructure
5. Documentation and guides
