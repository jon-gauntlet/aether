# Energy System Architecture

## Overview
The Energy System is a core component that manages and tracks various types of energy (mental, physical, emotional) and their interactions with flow states. It provides hooks and utilities for energy consumption, recovery, and optimization.

## Core Components

### 1. Energy Types
```typescript
enum EnergyType {
  MENTAL = 'MENTAL',
  PHYSICAL = 'PHYSICAL',
  EMOTIONAL = 'EMOTIONAL'
}
```

### 2. Flow States
```typescript
enum FlowState {
  FOCUS = 'FOCUS',
  FLOW = 'FLOW',
  HYPERFOCUS = 'HYPERFOCUS',
  RECOVERING = 'RECOVERING',
  EXHAUSTED = 'EXHAUSTED',
  DISTRACTED = 'DISTRACTED'
}
```

### 3. Energy Metrics
```typescript
interface EnergyMetrics {
  efficiency: number;    // Overall energy utilization
  sustainability: number; // Long-term viability
  recovery: number;      // Recovery rate
}
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. useEnergy Hook
The primary interface for energy management, providing:
- Energy level tracking for all types
- Flow state transitions
- Recovery mechanisms
- Optimization strategies
- Prediction capabilities

### 2. Energy Management
- **Consumption**: Controlled depletion of energy types
- **Recovery**: Automatic and manual recovery mechanisms
- **Optimization**: Flow state-based energy distribution
- **Monitoring**: Real-time metrics and warnings

### 3. Flow State Integration
- State transitions affect energy consumption
- Energy levels influence available states
- Recovery periods enforce optimal patterns
- Hyperfocus requires specific energy conditions

## Key Features

### 1. Energy Tracking
- Individual tracking of mental, physical, and emotional energy
- Normalized values between 0.0 and 1.0
- Real-time updates and calculations
- Depletion warnings and safeguards

### 2. Recovery System
- Automatic recovery during rest periods
- Enhanced recovery in RECOVERING state
- Progressive energy restoration
- Type-specific recovery rates

### 3. Flow State Management
- Energy-based state transitions
- Optimal state recommendations
- Performance bonuses in flow states
- Automatic exhaustion detection

### 4. Prediction System
- Energy cost predictions for states
- Duration estimates for activities
- Resource requirement calculations
- Optimization recommendations

## Integration Points

### 1. Autonomic System
- Energy metrics inform autonomic decisions
- Flow state coordination
- Pattern-based optimization
- Recovery synchronization

### 2. Pattern System
- Energy patterns influence learning
- Flow state pattern detection
- Recovery pattern optimization
- Performance pattern tracking

### 3. Context System
- Energy context awareness
- State-based context switching
- Resource allocation optimization
- Performance history tracking

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Energy Management
```typescript
const { energy, consume, startRecovery } = useEnergy();

// Consume mental energy
consume(EnergyType.MENTAL, 0.2);

// Start recovery when needed
if (energy.mental < 0.3) {
  startRecovery();
}
```

### 2. Flow State Optimization
```typescript
const { optimize, transitionTo, currentState } = useEnergy();

// Optimize for flow state
optimize(FlowState.FLOW);

// Transition when ready
if (currentState !== FlowState.FLOW) {
  transitionTo(FlowState.FLOW);
}
```

### 3. Energy Prediction
```typescript
const { predictEnergyNeeds } = useEnergy();

// Get energy requirements for hyperfocus
const needs = predictEnergyNeeds(FlowState.HYPERFOCUS);
console.log(`Mental energy needed: ${needs.mental}`);
```
