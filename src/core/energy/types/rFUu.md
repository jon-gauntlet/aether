# Recovery Status Update - 2024-01-10 07:07 AM PST

## Initial Recovery Attempt Results
- Enhanced recovery script deployed
- Directory structure recreated
- Recovery logging system established
- No files recovered in first pass

## Next Steps

### 1. Script Enhancement
- [ ] Add support for partial path matching
- [ ] Implement fuzzy file signature matching
- [ ] Add support for recovering files without explicit path markers
- [ ] Enhance conflict detection with content-based comparison

### 2. Manual Recovery Tasks
- [ ] Review Cursor history files manually for key components
- [ ] Extract type definitions from existing files
- [ ] Reconstruct core system interfaces
- [ ] Rebuild test infrastructure

### 3. Immediate Actions
1. Modify script to handle TypeScript/JavaScript files without explicit path markers
2. Add content-based signature generation for better file matching
3. Implement recursive directory scanning for history files
4. Add support for recovering test files based on naming patterns

## Current System State

### Core Systems
1. **Energy System** - Partially Recovered
   - ✅ Basic structure
   - ⚠️ Missing tests
   - ⚠️ Incomplete type definitions

2. **Autonomic System** - Partially Recovered
   - ✅ Core components
   - ⚠️ Missing integration tests
   - ⚠️ Incomplete validation logic

3. **Empty Systems**
   - ❌ Flow System
   - ❌ Fields System
   - ❌ Metrics System
   - ❌ Protection System
   - ❌ Context System
   - ❌ Hooks System
   - ❌ Integration System
   - ❌ Patterns System

## Recovery Metrics
- Files Recovered: 0/~50 estimated
- Systems Recovered: 2/10
- Test Coverage: Unknown
- Type Definitions: Partial

## Immediate Focus
1. Enhance recovery script capabilities
2. Begin manual recovery of core system files
3. Extract and reconstruct type definitions
4. Rebuild test infrastructure
