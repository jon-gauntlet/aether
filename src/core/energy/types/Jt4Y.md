# AI-First Autonomic Agile Implementation Wisdom

## Core Patterns

### 1. Pattern Evolution System
```typescript
interface EvolutionMetrics {
  strength: number;
  coherence: number;
  resonance: number;
  stability: number;
  adaptability: number;
  statistics: {
    mean: number;
    variance: number;
    skewness: number;
    kurtosis: number;
    trend: number;
  };
}
```

- Patterns evolve naturally through use
- Metrics capture both immediate and long-term health
- Statistical analysis ensures robust evolution
- Protection increases with pattern value

### 2. Flow State Protection
```typescript
interface FlowProtection {
  level: number;
  type: 'soft' | 'medium' | 'hard';
  conditions: {
    minEnergy: number;
    minCoherence: number;
    maxInterruptions: number;
  };
  recovery: {
    baseTime: number;
    energyFactor: number;
    adaptivePeriod: number;
  };
}
```

- Flow states are protected based on value
- Protection adapts to energy levels
- Recovery periods scale with depth
- Interruptions managed adaptively

### 3. Adaptive Validation
```typescript
interface ValidationThreshold {
  base: number;
  energyFactor: number;
  contextFactor: number;
  historyFactor: number;
  minValue: number;
  maxValue: number;
}
```

- Validation thresholds adapt to context
- Energy levels influence strictness
- Historical success shapes requirements
- Protection scales with importance
