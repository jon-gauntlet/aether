# ChatGenius

A natural mind extension for communication, designed to preserve the health and natural condition of the mind, especially for ADHD users.

## Vision

ChatGenius reimagines communication from the ground up, creating a fundamentally different paradigm that feels like a natural extension of consciousness. Instead of adding ADHD features to a traditional chat app, we've built a system that flows with the natural patterns of thought and attention.

## Core Principles

1. **Natural Flow**: The system moves like a mountain stream, following the path of least resistance while maintaining depth and clarity.

2. **Mind Extension**: Technology should feel like a natural extension of consciousness, preserving and enhancing our natural thought patterns.

3. **Organic Growth**: Features emerge naturally from use, evolving with the needs and patterns of users.

4. **Deep Presence**: The system supports and protects states of deep focus and flow.

5. **Natural Connection**: Communication flows naturally between minds, preserving the organic quality of thought.

## Features

- **Consciousness Engine**: Manages the flow and evolution of thoughts
- **Presence System**: Protects and maintains states of focus and flow
- **Thought Streams**: Natural organization of ideas and conversations
- **Mind Spaces**: Organic spaces for different types of interaction
- **Energy System**: Manages and preserves mental energy
- **Natural Protection**: Guards against interruptions and distractions

## Technical Architecture

The system is built on a foundation of:

- TypeScript for type safety and clarity
- RxJS for reactive streams and natural flow
- Node.js for the server environment
- PostgreSQL for persistent storage
- Redis for real-time state management
- WebSocket for live connections
