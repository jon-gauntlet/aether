- Added base type definitions

## Current System State

### Core Systems
1. **Energy System** - Partially Recovered
   - ✅ Basic structure
   - ⚠️ Missing tests
   - ⚠️ Incomplete type definitions

2. **Flow System** - Mostly Recovered
   - ✅ Core implementation
   - ✅ Energy integration
   - ✅ State management
   - ⚠️ Missing tests
   - ✅ Type definitions

3. **Autonomic System** - Partially Recovered
   - ✅ Core components
   - ⚠️ Missing integration tests
   - ⚠️ Incomplete validation logic

4. **Empty Systems**
   - ❌ Fields System
   - ❌ Metrics System
   - ❌ Protection System
   - ❌ Context System
   - ❌ Hooks System
   - ❌ Integration System
   - ❌ Patterns System

## Recovery Metrics
- Files Recovered: ~5/50 estimated
- Systems Recovered: 2.5/10
- Test Coverage: Partial
- Type Definitions: Improving

## Next Steps
