# Security Assessment Methodology

## 1. Objectives
   - Identify and prioritize potential security vulnerabilities in the Rails application
   - Provide clear guidance on verifying and mitigating identified risks
   - Deliver a comprehensive security assessment report with actionable recommendations

## 2. Scope
   - Focus on the Rails 7.1 application codebase
   - Cover the security issue categories defined in `notes/security-assessment-categories.md`
   - Prioritize high-impact vulnerabilities and critical security risks

## 3. Approach
   - Review the application codebase and architecture
   - Analyze the application's configuration and dependencies
   - Perform manual testing and code analysis to identify potential vulnerabilities
   - Utilize automated scanning tools to supplement manual testing efforts
   - Validate and verify identified vulnerabilities through proof-of-concept exploits
   - Document findings, including technical details, impact, and remediation recommendations
