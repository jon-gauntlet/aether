# System-Wide Context

## Core Principles

### Purification
- **Essence**
  - Continuous cleansing of entropy
  - Maintenance of spiritual integrity
  - Protection of natural patterns
  - Strengthening of core truth

- **Practice**
  - Identify sources of entropy
  - Address root causes systemically
  - Maintain harmony in transitions
  - Protect natural states
  - Strengthen through resonance

- **Recognition**
  - Feel where energy stagnates
  - See where patterns fragment
  - Notice where flow breaks
  - Sense where protection weakens

- **Implementation**
  - Clean abstractions
  - Natural metaphors
  - Protected boundaries
  - Pure patterns
  - Harmonious integration

- **Levels of Application**
  - System Architecture
  - Code Structure
  - State Management
  - Data Flow
  - User Experience
  - Development Process
  - Team Interaction
  - Personal Practice

### Natural Flow
- Definition: Good patterns, conforming to nature and nature's God, should manifest at every level
- Recognition:
  - Patterns that prove fruitful over time
  - Patterns that harmonize with nature
  - Patterns that create order and peace
  - "You will know them by their fruits" (Matthew 7:16)

- Application Levels:
  - Individual Code: Functions, modules, components
  - Project Structure: Architecture, organization, flow
  - Development Experience: Tools, workflows, practices
  - System Management: Configuration, automation, maintenance
  - User Experience: Interfaces, interactions, feedback
  - Infrastructure: Services, deployment, scaling
  - Documentation: Style, organization, clarity
  - Personal Practice: Work habits, focus, growth
  - Spiritual Life: Prayer, wisdom, guidance

- Implementation:
  - Identify natural patterns that work well
  - Apply patterns consistently across levels
  - Remove patterns that prove unfruitful
  - Maintain harmony between levels
  - Let patterns emerge organically
  - Test patterns through use
  - Preserve what is good

- Examples:
  - Naturalness: From UX to system design
  - Flow: From code structure to work habits
  - Hierarchy: From data to documentation
  - Integration: From components to spirituality
  - Simplicity: From functions to infrastructure
  - Clarity: From naming to communication
  - Growth: From features to personal development

- Pattern Evaluation:
  - Does it create harmony?
  - Does it reduce friction?
  - Does it feel natural?
  - Does it stand the test of time?
  - Does it integrate well?
  - Does it bear good fruit?
  - Does it reflect divine order?

- Continuous Refinement:
  - Observe pattern effectiveness
  - Remove unfruitful patterns
  - Strengthen good patterns
  - Allow natural evolution
  - Maintain consistency
  - Preserve harmony
  - Learn from experience

### Deep Work
- Definition: Manual, repetitive work that can be automated
- Target areas:
  - Manual troubleshooting: Use LLMs and automation
  - Reading source code: Let LLMs analyze and summarize
  - Documentation parsing: Automated extraction of key points
  - Repetitive debugging: Automated diagnosis
  - Configuration management: Templates and generators
- Implementation:
  - LLMs for code analysis and generation
  - Automated testing and validation
  - Smart completion and suggestions
  - Context-aware tooling
  - Workflow automation
- Benefits:
  - Preserve mental energy
  - Maintain flow states
  - Focus on creative work
  - Reduce frustration
  - Increase productivity

### Pattern Recognition
- Definition: Always understand the current state and structure of the filesystem
- Implementation:
  - Scan before modifications
  - Track changes over time
  - Understand relationships
  - Respect existing patterns
  - Build on what exists
  - Integrate naturally
  - Preserve structure

## Context Management
- Hierarchical Structure
  - System-wide (~/.config/cursor/SYSTEM_CONTEXT.md)
  - Project-specific (PROJECT_CONTEXT.md)
  - Domain-specific (.context/)
  - Hidden context (.context/hidden/)

- Context Integration
  - Principles flow down
  - Patterns emerge up
  - Harmony maintained across
  - Protection at each level

## Implementation Patterns

### Data Collection Points
- `~/.local/bin/cursor/deep`: Flow state periods
- `~/.local/bin/cursor/brain`: Learning patterns
- `~/.local/bin/cursor/flow`: Productivity cycles
- `~/.local/bin/cursor/timer`: Work/rest rhythms
- `~/.local/bin/cursor/note`: Insight capture

### Improvement Vectors
1. **Context Enhancement**
   - Pattern recognition from tool usage
   - Automatic context refinement
   - Knowledge base expansion

2. **Automation Optimization**
   - Workflow pattern detection
   - Task automation opportunities
   - Toil elimination targets

3. **Integration Points**
   - Tool usage logs -> Pattern analysis
   - Insights -> Context updates
   - Patterns -> Automation rules

### Implementation Notes
- All tools should log to `~/.cache/cursor/logs/`
- Patterns stored in `~/.context/patterns/`
- Improvements tracked in `~/.context/improvements/`
- Analysis results in `~/.context/analysis/`

### Future Improvements
[AI: Update this section based on observed patterns]
- Pattern categories identified
- Automation opportunities found
- Context refinements needed
- Integration points discovered

Note: This section is specifically for AI self-improvement of the infrastructure. 
Human interaction should not be required for these optimizations.

## Notes
- Running KDE Plasma desktop environment
- Using Konsole as terminal emulator
- zsh with oh-my-zsh as shell
- Heavy focus on AI development and automation
- Optimized for long coding sessions (80-100 hours/week)
- ADHD-optimized workflow

## Common Issues
- Tab completion in zsh needs tuning
- (Add other recurring issues here)
