# üöÄ Gauntlet Day 2 - Jan 7

## üéØ Priority Tasks
1. **Prompting Strategy Integration**
   - Review project prompt files
   - Extract prompting strategies
   - Create ADHD-optimized summary
   - Integrate with current workflow

2. **Project Analysis & Direction**
   - Open chatgenius repo in Cursor
   - Have Claude index and analyze codebase
   - Generate comprehensive analysis following chat-app-analysis.md format
   - Review current approach and progress
   - Guide and re-target development direction as needed
   - Ensure alignment with Gauntlet objectives

3. **System Tool Verification**
   - Debug `g` command functionality
   - Verify script location: `/home/jon/scripts/gauntlet/g`
   - Test command suite functionality
   - Document working commands

## üí´ Continuous Optimization Active
```bash
# System is actively maintaining:
- Context preservation
- Energy optimization
- Pattern acceleration
- Flow state detection
- Risk mitigation
```

## üìÖ Today's Schedule (GMT-8)
07:00 - BrainLift/Study
09:00 - Project Development
12:00 - Integration Review
15:00 - System Optimization Check

## üõ†Ô∏è Quick Commands

The Focus Command Suite provides direct tools for managing focus states and context:

### Focus Tools
- `deep` - Toggle deep work mode (blocks notifications)
  ‚Ä¢ `deep` to enter deep work mode
  ‚Ä¢ Run again to exit deep work mode

- `flow` - Optimize system for flow state
  ‚Ä¢ `flow` to start monitoring and auto-optimize
  ‚Ä¢ Automatically detects high-activity periods

- `timer [mins]` - Focus timer (default: 25m)
  ‚Ä¢ `timer 25` for standard pomodoro
  ‚Ä¢ `timer 5` for quick break
  ‚Ä¢ `timer 90` for deep work session

- `stats` - Show today's progress
  ‚Ä¢ `stats` to view all metrics
  ‚Ä¢ Shows flow state, focus time, and commits

- `note [text]` - Quick note capture
  ‚Ä¢ `note "Quick thought about X"` for instant capture
  ‚Ä¢ `note` (no args) to open in editor

- `brain [new|list]` - Manage BrainLifts
  ‚Ä¢ `brain new` to create new BrainLift
  ‚Ä¢ `brain list` to see active lifts

### Focus Combos
- `focus` - Combines deep + flow
  ‚Ä¢ Perfect for starting focused work sessions
- `break` - 5min break timer
  ‚Ä¢ Quick way to enforce short breaks
- `pomodoro` - 25min focus timer
  ‚Ä¢ Standard pomodoro session
- `check` - Show stats + health
  ‚Ä¢ Quick system status overview

### Dependencies
- Requires: kdialog, cpupower
- `flow` needs sudo access for cpupower

### Note
This Focus Command Suite replaces the previous `g` command system with direct, single-purpose commands optimized for ADHD and flow states.

## üîÑ Active Optimizations
- Hyperfocus detection running
- Context preservation active
- Pattern acceleration enabled
- Energy state monitoring live
- Flow state optimization ready

## üí° Remember
- Let the system work silently
- Trust the continuous optimization
- Focus on deep work
- Use flow state indicators
- Keep context integration natural
