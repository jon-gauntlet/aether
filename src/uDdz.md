## Key Recommendations for Dependency Management and CVEs in @codebase[app]
Based on [Section 11 - Dependency Management and CVEs](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#dependency-management-and-cves) of the Rails Security Guide.

1. Regularly update and patch the application's dependencies, including Rails, Ruby, and all third-party gems. Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `brakeman` to scan the application's `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities and security advisories.

2. Implement a dependency management process that includes monitoring for new releases, security patches, and CVEs related to the application's dependencies. Subscribe to security mailing lists, such as the Ruby on Rails security mailing list, and keep an eye on the GitHub repositories of the dependencies for any security-related announcements.

3. Establish a process for quickly assessing and prioritizing the impact of newly discovered vulnerabilities or CVEs in the application's dependencies. Develop a plan for applying the necessary patches or updating the affected dependencies in a timely manner.

4. Use a dependency version locking mechanism, such as `Gemfile.lock`, to ensure that the application uses consistent and tested versions of its dependencies across different environments. Avoid using loose version constraints or dynamically resolving dependencies during runtime.

5. Implement a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that includes automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checking. Integrate tools like `bundler-audit` or `brakeman` into the CI/CD process to identify and alert on any security issues introduced by dependency updates.

6. Regularly review and audit the application's dependencies for unused or unnecessary gems. Remove any dependencies that are no longer required to reduce the attack surface and minimize the potential impact of vulnerabilities in those dependencies.

7. Consider using a dependency management service or tool, such as Dependabot or Snyk, to automatically monitor and update the application's dependencies based on security advisories and new releases. These tools can help streamline the dependency management process and ensure that the application stays up to date with the latest security patches.
