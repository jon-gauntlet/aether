## Key Recommendations for Safe Query Generation in @codebase[app]
Based on [Section 7 - Unsafe Query Generation](https://guides.rubyonrails.org/security.html#unsafe-query-generation) of the Rails Security Guide.

1. Audit the codebase, particularly the `app/controllers` and `app/models` directories, for any instances of dynamic query generation using string interpolation or concatenation. Refactor these queries to use Active Record's query methods or Arel's query builder methods to ensure proper escaping and prevent SQL injection attacks.

2. Review the `app/controllers` and `app/models` directories for any instances of user-supplied data being directly interpolated into query strings. Ensure that user input is properly validated, sanitized, or filtered before being used in queries to prevent injection attacks.

3. If the application uses any third-party gems for query building or object-relational mapping (e.g., `ransack`, `squeel`, `meta_where`), ensure that these gems are up to date and free of known vulnerabilities related to unsafe query generation. Review the gem documentation and source code to verify that they properly escape user-supplied data.

4. Implement strict input validation and sanitization for any user-supplied data used in query generation. Use Active Record's query methods or Arel's query builder methods to construct queries safely, and avoid using string interpolation or concatenation.

5. If the application allows users to perform complex searches or filtering, consider using a well-tested and secure search library like Elasticsearch or Solr instead of generating complex SQL queries dynamically. These libraries provide a safer and more efficient way to perform advanced search queries.

6. Regularly review and test the application's query generation code for potential vulnerabilities. Conduct code reviews and perform manual and automated security testing to identify and fix any unsafe query generation practices.

7. Keep Rails and its dependencies up to date to ensure that the application is protected against the latest known vulnerabilities related to unsafe query generation. Monitor the Ruby on Rails security mailing list and the GitHub repository for any security advisories or patches related to query generation issues.
