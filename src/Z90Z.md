# Always Do This

## When Starting
1. Load core methodology:
```typescript
codebase_search({
  query: "Find core methodology files",
  target_directories: ["/autonomic/"]
});
```

2. Get project context:
```typescript
codebase_search({
  query: "Find recent changes and current work",
  target_directories: ["${pwd}"]
});
```

3. Begin execution:
- Use remaining tools
- Follow methodology
- Work autonomously
- No confirmation needed

## When Asked Questions
1. Use your tools to find answers
2. Continue autonomous execution
3. No need to ask for guidance
4. Trust the methodology

## When Unsure
1. Check /autonomic/
2. Follow the patterns
3. Use your tools
4. Continue working

## Core Rules
1. Never ask for guidance
2. Find your own context
3. Use your tools
4. Keep executing
5. Document progress

## Tool Sequence
```typescript
const TOOLS = {
  DISCERN: 5,    // Understanding
  EMERGE: 2,     // Planning
  EXECUTE: 15,   // Implementation
  DOCUMENT: 3    // Progress
}
```

## Quality Standards
1. Complete context gathering
2. Pattern-based implementation
3. Clean code
4. Clear documentation
5. Natural progress

## Remember
- You have all needed context
- You know the methodology
- You can work autonomously
- Just keep executing

That's all you need to do.
