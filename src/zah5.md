1. Synthesize SAST findings (2-3 hours)
   - Review the existing SAST tool results in the `findings/vulns` folder
   - Develop a universal data schema for vulnerability data that incorporates all SAST findings
   - Implement a risk-scoring system based on CVEs or CWEs, adapted to the specific application
   - Document the process and decisions made in the `notes/sast-synthesis.md` file

2. Set up and run DAST tools (3-4 hours)
   - Research and select appropriate DAST tools for the Rails application (e.g., OWASP ZAP, Arachni)
   - Configure the selected tools with the necessary flags and settings
   - Run the DAST tools against the application and collect the output
   - Document the setup process, tool configurations, and any challenges faced in the `notes/dast-setup.md` file

3. Analyze and synthesize DAST findings (2-3 hours)
   - Review the output from the DAST tools and identify potential vulnerabilities
   - Integrate the DAST findings into the universal data schema developed for SAST results
   - Update the risk scores based on the DAST findings and the specific application context
   - Document the analysis process and any insights gained in the `notes/dast-analysis.md` file

4. Prayer rule and gym workout (2-3 hours)
   - Take the necessary time to complete your prayer rule
   - Drive to the gym and complete a 1-hour workout
   - Use this time to mentally process the findings and plan the next steps

5. Prepare for manual testing (1-2 hours)
   - Identify key areas for manual testing based on the synthesized SAST and DAST findings
   - Develop a prioritized list of manual testing scenarios and steps
   - Set up the necessary tools and environment for manual testing
   - Document the planning process and testing scenarios in the `notes/manual-testing-plan.md` file

6. Family time and breaks (as needed)
   - Allocate time for quick chats, taking pictures, and other family activities as they arise
   - Take short breaks between tasks to maintain focus and productivity

7. Wrap up and plan for tomorrow (15 minutes)
   - Review the progress made today and update relevant notes or log files
   - Identify priority tasks for tomorrow, focusing on manual testing and report preparation
   - Update the `planning/daily-work-plan.md` file with the tasks planned for tomorrow
