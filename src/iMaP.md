# Assignment prompt

Your task is to review the application for any security issues and
report on these in a way that describes the threat, one or more
options for fixing any vulnerabilities, and ways to prevent
introducing similar vulnerabilities in the future. If you have
ideas on how to detect if a vulnerability has been exploited
in the past, that is also appreciated!

You **do not** need to provide automated exploits or complex fixes
beyond a few example lines of code.

For any areas you investigate and do not find security issues,
please also note what potential issues you were looking for and
why you believe the code you looked at may not be vulnerable.

Feel free to use any resources you might normally use in evaluating
code, e.g. Google, Stack Overflow, IDE tools, etc.
