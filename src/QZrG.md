# Findings Schema and Scoring

Here are some suggestions for creating a common schema for the security findings in your @codebase[project] /findings directory and scoring them in the context of the @codebase[app]] application:

1. Review the existing findings and identify the key information fields that are common across most of them. Based on a quick scan, some potential fields could be:
- Title: Brief description of the vulnerability 
- Description: Detailed explanation of the issue
- Severity: Rating of the risk level (high, medium, low)
- CWE: Relevant CWE identifier if applicable 
- Location: File path and line number where vulnerability exists
- Recommendation: Suggested remediation steps

2. Define a simple JSON schema that captures those core fields, while allowing some flexibility. For example:

```json
{
  "title": "String",
  "description": "String", 
  "severity": "high|medium|low",
  "cwe": "String",
  "location": {
    "file": "String",
    "line": "Integer"  
  },
  "recommendation": "String"
}
```

3. Write a script to parse the existing findings and convert them to this standardized JSON format. You may need some custom logic to map fields from various tools/sources. Store the normalized findings in a new directory.

4. To score the findings, write another script that loads each JSON file, checks the `location` against the @codebase[app]] source code, and assigns a severity based on:
- Ease of exploitability 
- Potential impact to application
- Sensitivity of affected component

You can define some heuristics for determining severity, like:
- High: Easy to exploit, high impact, critical component 
- Medium: Requires some skill to exploit, moderate impact, important component
- Low: Difficult to exploit, low impact, non-critical component

5. Have the script update the `severity` field in the JSON and output a summary report grouping findings by severity level. Also flag any issues found in @codebase[app]] that weren't covered by the original findings.

6. Document the schema and scoring methodology in the @codebase[project] README so that it can be consistently applied to future assessments.

7. Commit the updated findings and scripts to the @codebase[project] repo. Update the main README to explain how to generate normalized findings and severity reports.

Let me know if you would like me to elaborate on any part of this process! I'm happy to review code or provide examples as you implement the solution.
