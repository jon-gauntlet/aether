# Python DSA Assessment Preparation

A focused repository for preparing for the CodeSignal Data Structures & Algorithms Assessment in Python 3, optimized for ADHD-friendly learning and quick review.

## Quick Start

1. **Setup Environment**
   ```bash
   pipenv install  # Install all dependencies
   pipenv shell   # Activate virtual environment
   ```

2. **25-Minute Practice Session**
   - Review one concept (5 min)
   - Solve one problem (15 min)
   - Study solution (5 min)

3. **Assessment Preparation**
   ```python
   # In Cursor, open a new Composer window and type:
   /help quiz me on python data structures and algorithms
   ```

## Using This Repository

### For Quick Review (15-30 minutes)
1. Start with `review/flashcards/`
2. Check relevant `review/cheatsheets/`
3. Practice with a template from `practice/templates/`

### For Deep Learning (25-minute sessions)
1. Study a concept in `learn/concepts/`
2. Implement it using templates
3. Solve related problems in `practice/`

### For Assessment Prep
1. Take a mock test in `quiz/mock_tests/`
2. Review solutions in `quiz/solutions/`
3. Track progress in `quiz/timing/`

## Using Cursor with Claude

1. **Start a Quiz Session**
   - Open Cursor
   - Create new file or open existing
   - Press `/` to open command palette
   - Type "quiz me on [topic]"

2. **Get Help During Practice**
   - Select code you want help with
   - Press `/` and describe your question
   - Use natural language to ask for hints

3. **Review Solutions**
   - After attempting a problem
   - Ask Claude to explain the solution
   - Request step-by-step breakdowns

## Tips for Success

1. **Time Management**
   - Read all questions first (5 min)
   - Start with easiest question
   - Leave 10 min for review

2. **Problem Solving Strategy**
   - Read and understand the problem
   - Consider edge cases
   - Write test cases first
   - Code the solution
   - Test and optimize

3. **Python Best Practices**
   - Use built-in functions
   - Leverage standard library
   - Write clean, readable code
   - Comment your logic

4. **Common Patterns**
   - Two pointers
   - Sliding window
   - Hash table lookups
   - DFS/BFS traversal

## Getting Help

1. Use Cursor's Claude integration:
   ```
   /help I'm stuck on [problem]. Here's my approach: [code]
   ```

2. Review similar problems:
   ```
   /find similar problems to [current problem]
   ```

3. Debug your code:
   ```
   /explain what's wrong with this code: [code]
   ```
