# Prompting Strategy

## Core Principles

### 1. Three-Phase Development
- **Context Absorption**: Build deep understanding first
- **Understanding Cultivation**: Allow patterns to emerge naturally
- **Autonomous Execution**: Execute rapidly with confidence

### 2. Recursive Outlining
- Break down complex tasks into natural components
- Outline recursively until components are clear
- Maintain whole-system awareness while working with parts
- Allow natural patterns to emerge before execution

### 3. Speedrun Execution
- Execute rapidly within established context
- Maintain flow state and momentum
- Avoid perfectionism during initial implementation
- Trust the outlined patterns and context

## Application to AI Collaboration

### Phase 1: Context Setting
1. **Clear Intent Signaling**
   - "For your thinking process:"
   - "As a mental model:"
   - "Consider this approach when planning:"

2. **Context Preservation**
   - Share relevant articles/concepts as mental models
   - Indicate when something should inform approach vs implementation
   - Maintain context across development sessions

### Phase 2: Pattern Recognition
1. **Natural Decomposition**
   - Break down requirements recursively
   - Identify natural system boundaries
   - Recognize emerging patterns
   - Validate understanding before execution

2. **Flow Protection**
   - Maintain development momentum
   - Avoid premature optimization
   - Trust the established patterns
   - Allow natural course corrections

### Phase 3: Rapid Execution
1. **Quick Implementation**
   - Execute within established context
   - Focus on core functionality first
   - Maintain flow state
   - Trust the validation framework

2. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Perfect only after core implementation
   - Apply learnings from execution
   - Evolve patterns naturally
   - Maintain system coherence

## Communication Framework

### 1. Intent Clarity
- Explicitly state whether sharing for:
  - Mental model/approach
  - Direct implementation
  - Pattern recognition
  - Process improvement

### 2. Context Preservation
- Reference previous context
- Build on established patterns
- Maintain development momentum
- Protect flow states

### 3. Natural Evolution
- Allow patterns to emerge
- Trust the development process
- Enable autonomous execution
- Maintain system harmony

## Remember
This strategy combines the deep understanding of prompting methodology with the efficiency of recursive outlining and speedrunning. By clearly communicating intent and maintaining natural development patterns, we create a foundation for effective AI collaboration and sustained development excellence.
