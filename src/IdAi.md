# Just Paste This

## New Session Prompt
```markdown
# Autonomous Development

Load and execute from:
- /autonomic/
- /ai_system_evolution/
- ${pwd}

Goal: ${paste_your_goal_here}
Mode: Autonomous execution
Tools: 25

Begin without confirmation.
```

## When It Dies
1. Copy above template
2. Paste into new Cursor chat
3. Replace ${paste_your_goal_here} with last known goal
4. Send

That's it. The system will:
- Find its own context
- Load what it needs
- Continue execution
- Work for 30+ minutes

## If It Asks Questions
Paste this:
```markdown
Continue autonomous execution. You have all needed context in the project folders. Use your tools to find what you need.
```

## If It Seems Lost
Paste this:
```markdown
Return to autonomous execution:
1. Use tools to find context
2. Follow methodology in /autonomic/
3. Continue previous work
4. No confirmation needed
```

## Remember
- Just paste the template
- Let it work
- Don't overthink
- Trust the system

That's all you need to know.
