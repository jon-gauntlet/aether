## Natural Development Flow

### Getting Started
The codebase grows like a living system. Start by exploring:
```bash
space explore    # Feel the space
space enter dev  # Flow into development
space sense      # Understand the currents
```

### Understanding the Space
- Code flows in natural patterns
- Features emerge organically
- Tests grow alongside code
- Documentation evolves naturally

### Making Changes
1. Let your changes flow with existing patterns
2. Grow features gradually
3. Keep connections natural
4. Maintain clarity

### Code Style
- Write code that reads naturally
- Let structure emerge from purpose
- Keep complexity organic
- Build clear paths for others

### Testing
- Tests should feel natural
- Cover core flows thoroughly
- Let edge cases emerge
- Keep assertions clear

### Documentation
- Grows with the code
- Reveals itself naturally
- Stays clear and helpful
- Evolves with use

### Review Process
- Share early
- Flow together
- Grow through feedback
- Maintain quality naturally

Remember: Like a healthy ecosystem, good code emerges from natural patterns and clear principles.
