"""
Path to Python Enlightenment - Array Sum

The goal is to learn array operations in Python through test-driven development.
Each test builds upon the previous ones, gradually increasing in complexity.

To begin your journey:
1. Read the test description
2. Run the tests (they will fail)
3. Read the failure message
4. Fix the code
5. Run the tests again
6. Reflect on what you learned
7. Move to the next test

Remember: The path to enlightenment is in the journey, not the destination.
