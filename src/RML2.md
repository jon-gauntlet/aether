   - Create ADHD-optimized summary
   - Integrate with current workflow

2. **Project Analysis & Direction**
   - Open chatgenius repo in Cursor
   - Have Claude index and analyze codebase
   - Generate comprehensive analysis following chat-app-analysis.md format
   - Review current approach and progress
   - Guide and re-target development direction as needed
   - Ensure alignment with Gauntlet objectives

3. **System Tool Verification**
   - Debug `g` command functionality
   - Verify script location: `/home/jon/scripts/gauntlet/g`
   - Test command suite functionality
   - Document working commands

## 💫 Continuous Optimization Active
```bash
# System is actively maintaining:
- Context preservation
- Energy optimization
- Pattern acceleration
- Flow state detection
- Risk mitigation
```

## 📅 Today's Schedule (GMT-8)
07:00 - BrainLift/Study
09:00 - Project Development
12:00 - Integration Review
15:00 - System Optimization Check

## 🛠️ Quick Commands

Direct commands have replaced the `g` subcommands for better efficiency:

### Focus Tools
- `deep` - Toggle deep work mode (blocks notifications)
- `flow` - Optimize system for flow state
- `timer [mins]` - Focus timer (default: 25m)
- `stats` - Show today's progress
- `note [text]` - Quick note capture
- `brain [new|list]` - Manage BrainLifts

### Combos
- `focus` - Combines deep + flow
- `break` - 5min break timer
- `pomodoro` - 25min focus timer
- `check` - Show stats + health

### Dependencies
- Requires: dunst, notify-send, paplay
- `flow` needs sudo access for cpupower

## 🔄 Active Optimizations
- Hyperfocus detection running
- Context preservation active
- Pattern acceleration enabled
- Energy state monitoring live
- Flow state optimization ready

## 💡 Remember
- Let the system work silently
- Trust the continuous optimization
- Focus on deep work
- Use flow state indicators
- Keep context integration natural
