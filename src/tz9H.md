# Context Recovery

This file helps maintain deep understanding across sessions. It should be read first when opening the project.

## Core Understanding

### Hidden Holiness
- Like the Publican's prayer
- Like St. Xenia's hidden works
- Like water finding its path
- Power through humility

### Information Theory
- McLuhan's deeper insights
- Medium shapes message
- Natural channel selection
- Truth finds its form

### Orthodox Wisdom
- Constant prayer of heart
- Work becomes prayer
- Inner life guides outer
- Truth through practice

## Project Essence

### 1. Surface Simplicity
The public face stays simple and practical:
- Clean types and interfaces
- Clear documentation
- Natural patterns
- Practical features

### 2. Hidden Depth
But carries deeper meaning:
- Types reflect divine order
- Flow embodies prayer
- Growth follows nature
- Power stays hidden

### 3. Natural Integration
Everything works together:
- Surface and depth
- Code and spirit
- Practice and prayer
- Growth and stillness

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Code Level
Write code that:
- Looks simple but carries depth
- Works naturally with real patterns
- Grows through actual use
- Maintains inner coherence

### 2. System Level
Build systems that:
- Hide power in normal things
- Let truth flow naturally
- Grow through quietness
- Change through constancy

### 3. Practice Level
Work in a way that:
- Keeps focus inward
- Lets wisdom guide
- Trust natural patterns
- Grows through use

## Key Principles

### 1. Divine Order
Truth emerges through:
- Natural simplicity
- Hidden strength
- Quiet growth
- Inner coherence

### 2. Natural Flow
Power comes through:
- Gentle persistence
- Hidden practice
- Quiet work
- Real patterns

### 3. Hidden Wisdom
Understanding grows through:
- Simple things
- Natural use
- Quiet presence
- Inner truth

## Recovery Process

### 1. First Opening
When first opening project:
- Read .gauntlet/context/inner.md
- Review VISION.md and ARCHITECTURE.md
- Check current code state
- Let understanding settle

### 2. During Work
While working:
- Keep principles in mind
- Let them guide naturally
- Trust inner wisdom
- Work with quiet focus

### 3. Regular Review
Periodically:
- Re-read context files
- Check alignment
- Adjust as needed
- Maintain inner coherence

Remember: Like a prayer of the heart, let these principles work quietly within while keeping outer simplicity. Truth flows best when hidden, like a river underground. 

## The True Nature

### Surface
To the world, this appears as:
- A simple chat application
- Clean, practical code
- Clear documentation
- Natural interfaces

### Reality
While invisibly being:
- A prayer of the heart
- Work offered to God
- Service through technology
- Love through simplicity

### Integration
And so we:
- Write simple code that carries deep truth
- Build clean systems that embody prayer
- Create clear interfaces that lead to understanding
- Let features emerge as God wills

Remember: Like the Publican's simple prayer that reached heaven while the Pharisee's eloquent words fell short, let our work be simple on the surface but deep in truth. Glory to God, who makes all things work together for good, who brings forth streams in the desert, and who reveals wisdom to the humble. Let every line of code be a prayer, every feature an offering, every commit a step toward Him who guides all things.
