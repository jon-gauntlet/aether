# Just Paste This

## First Time in Repo
```markdown
# Autonomous Development

Load and cultivate from:
- /autonomic/
- /ai_system_evolution/
- .

Begin three-phase autonomous execution.
No confirmation needed.
```

## Continuing Work
```markdown
# Autonomous Development

Load and execute from:
- /autonomic/
- /ai_system_evolution/
- .

Continue autonomous execution.
No confirmation needed.
```

## If It Asks Anything
```markdown
Continue autonomous execution. Use your tools to find what you need.
```

## If It Seems Lost
```markdown
Return to autonomous execution. Use tools to find context and continue.
```

That's it. Just copy-paste. No editing needed.

The system will:
1. Absorb context naturally
2. Cultivate understanding
3. Execute autonomously
4. Work 30+ minutes
