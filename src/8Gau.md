# Protection Directive Loader

## Purpose
Ensure all CCC (Cursor > Composer > Claude) sessions automatically load and respect critical protection directives.

## Critical Directives
1. Cursor Protection (`/home/jon/.config/cursor/contexts/sacred/principles/CURSOR_PROTECTION.md`)
   - Preserve Cursor functionality
   - Protect development environment
   - Maintain workspace integrity
   - Ensure resource availability

2. Arch System Protection (`/home/jon/.config/cursor/contexts/sacred/principles/ARCH_PROTECTION.md`)
   - Preserve system accessibility
   - Protect core functionality
   - Maintain login capability
   - Ensure system stability

## Loading Requirements
1. **When to Load**
   - At start of every CCC session
   - Before any system operations
   - Prior to automated tasks
   - On context switches

2. **Priority**
   - Load before other contexts
   - Override conflicting directives
   - Maintain throughout session
   - Refresh on major operations

3. **Validation**
   - Verify directives exist
   - Check file integrity
   - Validate content
   - Confirm loading

## Implementation
1. **System Claude**
   - Must load both directives
   - Stricter enforcement
   - Regular validation
   - Proactive monitoring

2. **Project Claude**
   - Must respect directives
   - Focus on workspace safety
   - Resource awareness
   - Path validation

## Enforcement
1. **Continuous**
   - Monitor compliance
   - Validate operations
   - Check resource usage
   - Verify paths

2. **Preventive**
   - Block unsafe operations
   - Validate changes
   - Preserve state
   - Log attempts

## Remember
- Protection is non-negotiable
- Load directives first
- Validate before operations
- Maintain throughout session
- When in doubt, check directives
