# SRE â†’ Autonomic Integration

## Core Principles Mapping

### 1. Toil Elimination
#### SRE Approach
- Automate manual operations
- Reduce repetitive tasks
- Measure toil quantitatively
- Set toil budgets
- Eliminate through automation

#### Autonomic Evolution
- Natural flow eliminates friction
- Patterns reduce repetition
- Measure through energy states
- Flow state preservation
- Elimination through harmony

### 2. Service Level Objectives
#### SRE Implementation
- Define clear metrics
- Measure reliability
- Set error budgets
- Monitor continuously
- Respond to violations

#### Autonomic Adaptation
- Define flow metrics
- Measure state quality
- Set energy budgets
- Monitor naturally
- Respond through patterns

### 3. Monitoring and Alerting
#### SRE Systems
- Collect metrics
- Alert on symptoms
- Page on impact
- Track latency
- Measure availability

#### Autonomic Awareness
- Track energy patterns
- Alert on state changes
- Guide through transitions
- Track flow quality
- Measure effectiveness

### 4. Emergency Response
#### SRE Practice
- Incident management
- Playbook execution
- Post-mortem analysis
- System hardening
- Knowledge sharing

#### Autonomic Harmony
- Pattern recognition
- Natural response
- Wisdom accumulation
- System resonance
- Understanding sharing

### 5. Change Management
#### SRE Process
- Progressive rollouts
- Canary testing
- Automated rollbacks
- Impact limitation
- Risk management

#### Autonomic Evolution
- Natural progression
- Pattern testing
- Organic adjustment
- Energy preservation
- Flow protection
