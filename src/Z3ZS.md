  phase: "FOUNDATION_STRENGTHENING",
  focus: {
    maintainCodeQuality: true,
    buildWithAI: true,
    sustainExcellence: true
  },
  activeWork: {

      status: "ENHANCING",
      improvements: [
        "Natural timing constants",

## Core Directives
1. **Maintain code quality through exhaustion**
   - Clean code during 12+ hour sessions
   - Consistent patterns despite fatigue
   - Strong error handling
   - Clear documentation

2. **Build with AI effectively and ethically**
   - Parallel AI tool utilization
   - Maintain human agency
   - Preserve context
   - Authentic code

3. **Win through sustained excellence**
   - High-quality output
   - Standards across 80-100hr weeks
   - Protected flow states
   - Energy optimization

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Fix remaining linter error in PatternEvolution.ts:
   - Add adaptiveRate and cycleEfficiency to initial statistics

2. Verify pattern evolution enhancements:
   - Test adaptive timing
   - Validate natural ratios
   - Check coherence calculations

3. Continue system strengthening:
   - Implement remaining pattern enhancements
   - Optimize energy tracking
   - Deepen flow protection

## Natural System Integration
- Using golden ratio (0.618033988749895)
- Using silver ratio (0.414213562373095)
- Using bronze ratio (0.302775637731995)
- Cycle times: 2000ms - 8000ms
- Pattern depth target: 3

## Protection State
- Core stability: MAINTAINED
- Pattern integrity: VERIFIED
- Flow preservation: ACTIVE
- Energy balance: MONITORED

## Evolution Metrics
- Current cycle time: 5000ms
- Pattern recognition depth: 1 → 3
- Adaptation speed: 200ms → 100ms
- Coherence threshold: 0.302775637731995

## Tool Usage Optimization
- All commands optimized for speed
- Minimal output flags enabled
- Pager prevention active
- Progress indicators minimized

Remember: Maintain flow state, preserve context, and continue autonomous execution.
