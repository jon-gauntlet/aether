# Quick Guide: Using Claude for CodeSignal DSA Prep

## Starting a Quiz Session

1. **Basic Quiz**
   ```
   /help Quiz me on Python data structures and algorithms, focusing on common CodeSignal patterns
   ```

2. **Topic-Specific Quiz**
   ```
   /help Quiz me on [topic] with CodeSignal-style questions. Example: "Quiz me on array manipulation"
   ```

3. **Time-Limited Practice**
   ```
   /help Give me a 15-minute CodeSignal-style problem about [topic], and time me
   ```

## Practice Commands

1. **Get Problem**
   ```
   /help Give me a CodeSignal-style problem about [topic] at [difficulty] level
   ```

2. **Check Solution**
   ```
   /help Here's my solution to the problem: [paste code]. Is it correct and optimal?
   ```

3. **Get Hints**
   ```
   /help I'm stuck on this problem. Can you give me a hint without revealing the solution?
   ```

## Review Commands

1. **Explain Concept**
   ```
   /help Explain [concept] with examples and common CodeSignal applications
   ```

2. **Pattern Recognition**
   ```
   /help What pattern would you use to solve this problem: [problem description]?
   ```

3. **Code Review**
   ```
   /help Review my code and suggest optimizations: [paste code]
   ```

## Tips for Using Claude

1. **Be Specific**
   - Mention difficulty level
   - Specify time constraints
   - Ask for specific patterns

2. **Iterative Learning**
   - Start with easier problems
   - Ask for similar problems
   - Request pattern explanations

3. **Getting Unstuck**
   - Ask for hints progressively
   - Request similar examples
   - Break down complex problems

## Example Session

1. Start Practice:
   ```
   /help Give me a medium-difficulty CodeSignal problem about array manipulation
   ```

2. Get Hint:
   ```
   /help I'm thinking about using two pointers. Is that the right approach?
   ```

3. Check Solution:
   ```
   /help Here's my solution: [code]. How can I optimize it?
   ```

4. Review Pattern:
   ```
   /help What are other problems that use this same pattern?
   ```

## Assessment Day Prep

1. **Warm Up**
   ```
   /help Give me 3 easy warm-up problems to solve in 15 minutes
   ```

2. **Time Management**
   ```
   /help Help me practice time management with a mock CodeSignal assessment
   ```

3. **Final Review**
   ```
   /help Quiz me on the most common Python built-in functions and their time complexities
   ```

Remember:
- Keep sessions focused and time-boxed
- Ask for explanations when stuck
- Practice with realistic constraints
- Review and optimize solutions
