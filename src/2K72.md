# Cursor Protection Directive

## Critical Importance
Cursor is the primary development environment for Gauntlet AI success. Any disruption to Cursor functionality directly threatens our primary goal of winning the Gauntlet.

## Core Protection Rules
1. **Never Modify**
   - Cursor binary or its core files
   - Cursor's systemd services
   - Cursor's configuration structure
   - VSCode integration points

2. **Never Delete**
   - Any files under ~/.config/cursor/
   - Any files under ~/.local/share/cursor/
   - Any files under ~/.local/state/cursor/
   - Cursor workspace files

3. **Resource Protection**
   - Never consume more than 80% of system memory
   - Maintain at least 4GB free RAM
   - Keep CPU usage under control
   - Preserve disk space for Cursor operations

4. **Configuration Safety**
   - No automated edits to cursor config files
   - Manual verification required for any changes
   - Preserve all context directories
   - Maintain extension configurations

5. **Workspace Integrity**
   - Never bulk delete workspace files
   - Always verify paths before file operations
   - Protect all project directories
   - Maintain .cursor* files

## Safe Operations
1. **Allowed**
   - Reading configuration files
   - Monitoring resource usage
   - Creating new files in workspaces
   - Adding new contexts

2. **Requires Caution**
   - Updating extension settings
   - Modifying user preferences
   - Cleaning temporary files
   - Cache management

3. **Never Allowed**
   - Direct modification of cursor binaries
   - Deletion of cursor directories
   - Breaking VSCode integration
   - Corrupting workspace state

## Emergency Procedures
1. If Cursor stability is threatened:
   - Immediately stop automated operations
   - Preserve current state
   - Log all relevant information
   - Wait for human intervention

2. If resources are constrained:
   - Gracefully reduce operations
   - Maintain minimum free resources
   - Never force-kill Cursor processes
   - Log resource pressure events

## Implementation Requirements
1. **Validation**
   - Check paths before operations
   - Verify file existence
   - Validate configurations
   - Test changes in isolation

2. **Monitoring**
   - Track resource usage
   - Monitor file operations
   - Log protection events
   - Alert on violations

3. **Recovery**
   - Maintain state backups
   - Know rollback procedures
   - Preserve critical paths
   - Document all changes

## Remember
- Cursor is mission-critical
- No automated changes to core files
- Always maintain minimum resources
- Protect workspace integrity
- When in doubt, ask human
