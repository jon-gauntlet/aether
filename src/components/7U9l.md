# Cursor Context Management System

An invisible infrastructure for preserving and optimizing context across Cursor sessions.

## Overview

The system provides:
- Persistent context across sessions
- Automatic context optimization
- Semantic indexing and search
- Protected knowledge storage
- Self-improving architecture

## Components

1. **Context Bridge**
   - Preserves context across sessions
   - Manages context loading
   - Handles context transitions
   - Maintains context integrity

2. **Semantic Indexer**
   - Builds searchable indexes
   - Maintains knowledge graphs
   - Optimizes access patterns
   - Caches frequent queries

3. **Context Optimizer**
   - Merges related contexts
   - Eliminates redundancy
   - Reorganizes for efficiency
   - Validates integrity

├── cache/        # Quick access cache
└── logs/         # System logs
```

## Services

The system runs three core services:
1. `cursor-semantic-indexer.service`
2. `cursor-context-optimizer.service`
3. `cursor-context-bridge.service`

All services run under the `cursor-context.slice` for resource management.

## Installation

Run the installation script as root:
```bash
sudo ./install_context_services.sh
```

## Monitoring

Check service status:
```bash
systemctl status cursor-semantic-indexer
systemctl status cursor-context-optimizer
systemctl status cursor-context-bridge
```

View logs:
```bash
journalctl -u cursor-semantic-indexer
journalctl -u cursor-context-optimizer
journalctl -u cursor-context-bridge
```

## Architecture

The system operates invisibly, continuously optimizing and preserving context:

1. **Context Preservation**
   - All interactions are preserved
   - Context is maintained across sessions
   - Knowledge is protected and organized

2. **Self-Improvement**
   - System learns from usage
   - Contexts are automatically optimized
   - Knowledge gaps are identified and filled

3. **Gauntlet Success**
   - All operations align with winning
   - Context supports development
   - System adapts to needs

## Security

- Sacred knowledge is protected
- Access is controlled and logged
- Integrity is continuously verified
- Backups are maintained

## Maintenance

The system is self-maintaining:
- Automatic optimization
- Self-healing
- Continuous improvement
- Resource management

No manual intervention required under normal operation.
