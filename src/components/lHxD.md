   - Lack of Multi-Factor Authentication
     - Risks: Account takeover, unauthorized access
     - Prevention: Implement MFA for sensitive actions and high-privilege accounts
   - Improper Session Termination
     - Risks: Unauthorized access, data exposure
     - Prevention: Proper session invalidation on logout, timeout, and access revocation

## 3. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Reflected XSS
     - Risks: User session hijacking, unauthorized actions, data theft
     - Prevention: Input validation, output encoding, CSP, secure coding practices
   - Stored XSS
     - Risks: Persistent unauthorized access, data manipulation, user compromise
     - Prevention: Input validation, output encoding, CSP, secure coding practices
   - DOM-based XSS
     - Risks: Client-side data manipulation, user session hijacking
     - Prevention: Secure JavaScript coding practices, input validation, output encoding

## 4. Insecure Direct Object References
   - Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data
     - Risks: Data disclosure, privacy violations, compliance issues
     - Prevention: Proper authorization checks, access control mechanisms
   - Improper Authorization Checks
     - Risks: Unauthorized access, privilege escalation
     - Prevention: Granular access control, principle of least privilege

## 5. Security Misconfiguration
   - Default or Weak Passwords
     - Risks: Unauthorized access, system compromise
     - Prevention: Change default passwords, enforce strong password policies
   - Unnecessary Services or Features Enabled
     - Risks: Increased attack surface, potential vulnerabilities
     - Prevention: Disable unused services, features, and ports
   - Improper Error Handling
     - Risks: Information disclosure, system insights for attackers
     - Prevention: Custom error pages, log errors securely, avoid detailed error messages
   - Outdated or Unpatched Software
     - Risks: Known vulnerabilities, system compromise
     - Prevention: Regular software updates, patch management process

## 6. Sensitive Data Exposure
   - Unencrypted Transmission of Sensitive Data
     - Risks: Data interception, privacy violations, compliance issues
     - Prevention: Use HTTPS/SSL/TLS for all sensitive data transmission
   - Inadequate Protection of Stored Sensitive Data
     - Risks: Data breach, unauthorized access, compliance violations
     - Prevention: Encrypt sensitive data at rest, secure key management
   - Lack of Secure Data Disposal
     - Risks: Data recovery, unauthorized access, compliance violations
     - Prevention: Secure data deletion, data retention policies

## 7. Missing Function Level Access Control
   - Improper Access Control for Critical Functions
     - Risks: Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, privilege escalation
     - Prevention: Granular access control, server-side authorization checks
   - Lack of Proper Authorization Checks
     - Risks: Unauthorized access, data disclosure, data manipulation
     - Prevention: Implement proper authorization mechanisms, principle of least privilege

## 8. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   - Lack of CSRF Tokens
     - Risks: Unauthorized actions, data manipulation, privilege escalation
     - Prevention: Implement CSRF tokens for all state-changing requests
   - Improper Validation of CSRF Tokens
     - Risks: CSRF token bypass, unauthorized actions
     - Prevention: Secure CSRF token generation and validation

## 9. Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
   - Outdated or Vulnerable Third-Party Libraries
     - Risks: Known vulnerabilities, system compromise, data breach
     - Prevention: Regular dependency updates, vulnerability monitoring, secure coding practices
   - Unpatched Framework or Server Software
     - Risks: Known vulnerabilities, system compromise, data breach
     - Prevention: Regular software updates, patch management process, secure configuration

## 10. Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards
    - Improper Validation of Redirects
      - Risks: Phishing, unauthorized access, user compromise
      - Prevention: Validate redirect destinations, use whitelisting, avoid user-controlled redirects
    - Lack of Proper Authorization for Forwards
      - Risks: Unauthorized access, privilege escalation
      - Prevention: Implement proper authorization checks for forwards, use secure coding practices

## Additional Considerations for Ruby on Rails Applications (@codebase[app])
   - Mass Assignment Vulnerabilities
     - Risks: Unauthorized attribute updates, privilege escalation
     - Prevention: Use strong parameters, whitelist allowed attributes, avoid using `permit!`
   - Insecure Deserialization
     - Risks: Remote code execution, object injection, DoS
     - Prevention: Avoid using `Marshal.load` or `YAML.load` on untrusted data, use safe parsing libraries
   - Insufficient Logging and Monitoring
     - Risks: Delayed detection of attacks, lack of forensic evidence
     - Prevention: Implement comprehensive logging, monitor for suspicious activities, use a centralized logging solution
   - Insecure Configuration of Rails Environments
     - Risks: Information disclosure, unauthorized access, system compromise
     - Prevention: Secure configuration for different environments, protect sensitive data in configuration files
