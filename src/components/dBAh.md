# Aether UI Patterns

## Component Architecture

### Pattern: Flow-Aware Components
```typescript
interface FlowAwareProps {
  flowAware?: boolean;     // Flow state responsiveness
  patternGuided?: boolean; // Pattern integration
  className?: string;      // Style extensibility
}
```

### Benefits
- Natural state adaptation
- Pattern-guided behavior
- Organic transitions
- Flow protection
- Quality emergence

## Implementation Strategy

### 1. Foundation First
```
└── UI Foundation
    ├── Layout System
    │   ├── Container (flow-aware)
    │   └── Grid (flow-responsive)
    ├── Base Components
    │   ├── Button (state-adaptive)
    │   └── Card (pattern-guided)
    └── Pattern Components
        └── Coming next...
```

### 2. Flow Integration
- State-based styling
- Level-based adaptation
- Natural transitions
- Pattern guidance
- Context preservation

### 3. Pattern Evolution
- Start minimal
- Add capabilities
- Follow patterns
- Enable growth
- Natural refinement

## Key Learnings

### 1. Component Design
- Flow awareness first
- Pattern integration second
- Natural adaptability
- Quality emergence
- Organic growth

### 2. Style Patterns
- State-based transforms
- Level-based refinements
- Natural transitions
- Pattern indicators
- Flow protection

### 3. Development Flow
- Types before implementation
- Core features first
- Natural evolution
- Pattern validation
- Quality emergence

## Remember

UI components should naturally adapt to flow states and patterns while maintaining quality through organic evolution. Build foundations that enable rapid development while preserving natural growth patterns.
