# V0 Implementation Plan

## Current Implementation Analysis

Our current implementation was built directly without going through v0. Here's how we should have approached it:

### 1. Data Models (v0 First Pass)
```typescript
// Example v0 prompt:
"Generate a Prisma schema for an LMS with:
- User roles (admin, instructor, student)
- Course hierarchy (courses, modules, lessons)
- Assignment and submission system
- Progress tracking
- Authentication integration"
```

### 2. API Routes (v0 Second Pass)
```typescript
// Example v0 prompt:
"Create tRPC router definitions for:
- Course management (CRUD)
- User management
- Enrollment system
- Progress tracking
- Assignment submission"
```

### 3. UI Components (v0 Third Pass)
```typescript
// Example v0 prompt:
"Generate React components using shadcn/ui for:
- Course dashboard
- Lesson viewer
- Assignment submission
- Progress tracking
- Admin interface"
```

## Implementation Gap Analysis

### What We Have
- Authentication system
- Database schema
- Basic API routes
- Core UI components

### What We Need from V0
1. **Enhanced Components**
   - Rich text editor for lessons
   - File upload system
   - Real-time collaboration tools
   - Interactive classroom features

2. **Additional Routes**
   - Real-time updates
   - Analytics endpoints
   - Media handling
   - Notification system

3. **Schema Extensions**
   - Media attachments
   - User notifications
   - Course metadata
   - Analytics tracking

## V0 to Cursor Transition Plan

1. **Export from V0**
   - Generated components
   - Route definitions
   - Schema updates

2. **Cursor Refinement**
   - Type safety improvements
   - Error handling
   - Performance optimizations
   - Test coverage

3. **Integration**
   - Component composition
   - State management
   - API integration
   - Authentication flow
