# Recovery Status Update - 2024-01-10 07:10 AM PST

## Latest Recovery Attempt
- Enhanced recovery script with improved detection capabilities:
  - Content-based file type detection
  - System-specific path determination
  - Intelligent signature generation
  - Conflict handling

## Script Improvements
✅ Added support for:
- Test file detection
- Component identification
- Type definition recovery
- Hook detection
- System-specific path mapping

## Next Steps

### 1. Script Enhancement
- [ ] Improve content analysis accuracy
- [ ] Add fuzzy matching for system detection
- [ ] Implement file content validation
- [ ] Add recovery verification steps

### 2. Manual Recovery Tasks
- [ ] Begin targeted recovery of core systems
- [ ] Extract and verify type definitions
- [ ] Reconstruct test infrastructure
- [ ] Validate recovered files

### 3. Immediate Actions
1. Add content validation to recovery script
2. Begin targeted recovery of Flow system
3. Extract type definitions from recovered files
4. Set up test infrastructure

## Current System State

### Core Systems
1. **Energy System** - Partially Recovered
   - ✅ Basic structure
   - ⚠️ Missing tests
   - ⚠️ Incomplete type definitions

2. **Autonomic System** - Partially Recovered
   - ✅ Core components
   - ⚠️ Missing integration tests
   - ⚠️ Incomplete validation logic

3. **Empty Systems**
   - ❌ Flow System (Next Priority)
   - ❌ Fields System
   - ❌ Metrics System
   - ❌ Protection System
   - ❌ Context System
   - ❌ Hooks System
   - ❌ Integration System
   - ❌ Patterns System

## Recovery Metrics
