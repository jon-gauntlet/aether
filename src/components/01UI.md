# ChatGenius Architecture

## Core Principles
- Keep things simple and clear
- Build what's actually needed
- Learn from real use
- Grow naturally
- Honor timeless patterns

## Pattern Layers

### 1. Natural Flow Layer
```typescript
// How energy moves
interface Flow {
  current: number;   // Natural movement
  depth: number;     // Still pools
  resonance: number; // Harmony
  protection: number;// Natural boundaries
}

// How spaces connect
interface Stream {
  source: string;
  destination: string;
  flow: Flow;
  history: FlowHistory[];
}
```

### 2. Consciousness Layer
```typescript
// States of being
interface Presence {
  depth: number;     // Focus level
  clarity: number;   // Understanding
  energy: number;    // Vitality
  protection: number;// Boundaries
}

// Thought patterns
interface Mind {
  presence: Presence;
  streams: Stream[];
  spaces: Space[];
  connections: Connection[];
}
```

### 3. Space Layer
```typescript
// Places to be
interface Space {
  id: string;
  type: SpaceType;
  flow: Flow;
  presence: Presence;
  inhabitants: string[];
}

// How things connect
interface Connection {
  from: Space;
  to: Space;
  strength: number;
  type: ConnectionType;
}
```

## Technology Integration

### 1. Frontend Flow
- React components follow natural patterns
- State transitions like water movement
- UI reveals itself organically
- Animations honor natural rhythm

### 2. Backend Harmony
- Data flows through natural paths
- State changes respect organic timing
- Protection increases with depth
- Connections strengthen through use

### 3. Testing Patterns
- Tests verify natural behavior
- Coverage grows organically
- Failures reveal needed paths
- Integration tests flow naturally

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Natural Development
- Start with core patterns
- Let complexity emerge
- Follow energy flows
- Trust organic growth

### 2. Flow Protection
- Guard deep states
- Preserve energy
- Honor natural boundaries
- Strengthen through use

### 3. Pattern Recognition
- Observe what works
- Strengthen good patterns
- Remove friction
- Trust emergence

Remember: Build in harmony with nature's patterns while honoring timeless wisdom.
