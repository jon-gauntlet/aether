    - Lack of content security policy (CSP)

15. **File and URL Security**
    - Insecure file uploads and downloads
    - Directory traversal vulnerabilities
    - Insecure URL access and handling

These categories provide a comprehensive coverage of potential security issues in a Rails 7.1 application. They align with the major categories from the Rails Security Guide and OWASP Rails Cheatsheet, while also considering the specific context of the application in @codebase[app].

As you proceed with your assessment, you can focus on each category, investigate potential vulnerabilities, verify their existence, understand the technical context, and document your findings in the `reports/final-report.md` file in @codebase[project]. Utilize the available resources, such as the Rails Security Guide, OWASP Cheatsheets, and web searches, to deepen your understanding of each security issue and its implications.

Remember to prioritize the identified issues based on their severity and potential impact on the application's security posture. Provide clear explanations and evidence to support your findings, and offer recommendations for mitigating the identified risks.
