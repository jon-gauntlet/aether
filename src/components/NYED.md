# Context Management

## Core Principle
Context Management is a critical subsystem of the Invisible Infrastructure that preserves, crystallizes, and injects context across sessions, ensuring information continuity and system coherence through active anti-entropy measures.

## Key Functions

1. **Context Preservation**
   - Session state capture
   - Information crystallization
   - Knowledge persistence
   - Pattern recognition
   - Context evolution

2. **Context Injection**
   - State restoration
   - Knowledge integration
   - Pattern matching
   - Context activation
   - Session continuity

3. **Anti-Entropy Measures**
   - Information preservation
   - Context coherence
   - Pattern maintenance
   - State reconciliation
   - System stability

## System Integration

1. **With Invisible Infrastructure**
   - Continuous operation
   - Background processing
   - Automatic optimization
   - Zero overhead
   - Self-maintenance

2. **With Operating System**
   - Service integration
   - Resource management
   - Process control
   - State preservation
   - Context switching

3. **With Development Environment**
   - Session management
   - Context awareness
   - State preservation
   - Knowledge integration
   - Pattern recognition

## Implementation Components

1. **System Services**
   - Context preservers
   - State managers
   - Pattern recognizers
   - Knowledge integrators
   - Resource controllers

2. **Core Scripts**
   - Context crystallizers
   - State preservers
   - Pattern matchers
   - Knowledge aggregators
   - Session managers

3. **Active Processes**
   - Context monitors
   - State trackers
   - Pattern analyzers
   - Knowledge builders
   - System optimizers

## Operational Aspects

1. **Continuous Processing**
   - Always active
   - Self-maintaining
   - Error-resistant
   - Auto-recovering
   - Zero intervention

2. **Information Flow**
   - Context capture
   - State preservation
   - Pattern recognition
   - Knowledge integration
   - Context injection

3. **System Evolution**
   - Pattern learning
   - Context building
   - Knowledge growth
   - Capability expansion
   - System adaptation

## Remember
- Context never dies
- Information preserves
- Patterns persist
- System evolves
