# Applying Rails Security Guide Recommendations to @codebase[app]

This document provides a comprehensive summary of how to apply the Key Recommendations from the Rails Security Guide and other relevant resources to the @codebase[app] application. Each recommendation includes a brief explanation of its relevance and actionable steps to implement it.

## 1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) Protection

1. **Ensure `protect_from_forgery` is enabled in `ApplicationController`** (Section 3)
   - Check the `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file and verify that the `protect_from_forgery` method is called.
   - If missing, add `protect_from_forgery with: :exception` to the `ApplicationController` class.

2. **Audit controllers for `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token`** (Section 3)
   - Search the `app/controllers` directory for any instances of `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token`.
   - For each occurrence, assess whether skipping CSRF protection is necessary and safe for that action.
   - If the action doesn't require session access, replace the skip with `protect_from_forgery with: :null_session`.

3. **Ensure CSRF token is included in all forms and AJAX requests** (Section 3)
   - Review the `app/views` directory and check that all forms include the `csrf_meta_tags` helper in their layout.
   - For AJAX requests, ensure the `X-CSRF-Token` header is set with the CSRF token value.

4. **Use `SameSite` cookie attribute for session and CSRF cookies** (OWASP Rails Cheat Sheet)
   - In the `config/initializers/session_store.rb` file, set the `same_site` option to `:strict` or `:lax` for the session cookie.
   - In the `config/initializers/cookies_serializer.rb` file, set the `same_site` option to `:strict` or `:lax` for the CSRF cookie.

## 2. Session Management

1. **Configure session store with a unique, random `session_key`** (Section 2)
   - Open the `config/initializers/session_store.rb` file and verify that the `session_key` option is set to a unique, random value.
   - If missing or using a default value, generate a new random `session_key` and update the configuration.

2. **Set `config.force_ssl = true` in production environment** (Section 2)
   - Open the `config/environments/production.rb` file and ensure that `config.force_ssl = true` is set.
   - This enforces HTTPS for all requests, protecting session data in transit.

3. **Implement session timeout mechanism** (Section 2)
   - In the `app/controllers/application_controller.rb` file, add a `before_action` to check for session timeout.
   - Compare the current timestamp with the last activity timestamp stored in the session.
   - If the idle time exceeds the desired timeout duration, invalidate the session and redirect the user to the login page.

4. **Secure session storage and encryption** (OWASP Rails Cheat Sheet)
   - Use a secure session storage mechanism like `ActiveRecord::SessionStore` or `Redis` instead of the default `CookieStore`.
   - Ensure the session data is encrypted using a strong encryption algorithm and a secure key.

5. **Regenerate session ID on authentication and privilege level changes** (OWASP Session Management Cheat Sheet)
   - After a successful login or when a user's privilege level changes, regenerate the session ID using `reset_session`.
   - This helps prevent session fixation attacks and ensures a fresh session for the authenticated user.

## 3. User Management

1. **Use a secure authentication library like Devise** (Section 5)
   - If the application uses a custom authentication system, consider replacing it with a well-tested library like Devise.
   - Follow the Devise installation and configuration instructions to set up secure user authentication.

2. **Implement password complexity requirements** (Section 5)
   - In the `app/models/user.rb` file, add validations for password complexity.
   - Require a minimum length, a combination of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.
   - Use a library like `devise-security` to enhance password security features.

3. **Implement account locking after failed login attempts** (Section 5)
   - In the `app/models/user.rb` file, add a mechanism to lock user accounts after a certain number of failed login attempts.
   - Use Devise's `lockable` module or implement a custom solution to track failed attempts and lock accounts.

4. **Securely hash and salt passwords** (OWASP Password Storage Cheat Sheet)
   - Use a secure password hashing algorithm like `bcrypt` or `Argon2` to store user passwords.
   - Ensure each password is hashed with a unique salt to prevent rainbow table attacks.

5. **Implement secure password reset functionality** (OWASP Forgot Password Cheat Sheet)
   - Generate unique, time-limited password reset tokens and send them to the user's registered email address.
   - Ensure the password reset links expire after a short period and are invalidated after being used.

6. **Validate and sanitize user input** (OWASP Input Validation Cheat Sheet)
   - Implement server-side validation and sanitization for all user-supplied data, such as names, email addresses, and passwords.
   - Use Active Record validations, strong parameters, or a validation library like `dry-validation` to validate and filter user input.

## 4. Injection Prevention

1. **Refactor raw SQL queries to use Active Record methods** (Section 6)
   - Search the `app/controllers` and `app/models` directories for any instances of raw SQL queries using string interpolation or concatenation.
   - Replace these queries with Active Record's query methods or parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

2. **Validate and sanitize user input before using in queries** (Section 6)
   - Review the `app/controllers` directory for any instances of user input being directly used in Active Record queries or model methods.
   - Implement strong parameter filtering and validation to ensure only permitted and sanitized data is used in queries.

3. **Escape user input when outputting to views** (Section 6)
   - In the `app/views` directory, locate any instances of user-supplied data being directly output without proper escaping.
   - Use Rails' built-in view helpers like `h` or `raw` to escape HTML entities and prevent XSS attacks.

4. **Sanitize and validate user input for file uploads** (OWASP Unrestricted File Upload)
   - If the application allows file uploads, implement strict file type and content validation on the server-side.
   - Use a library like `CarrierWave` or `ActiveStorage` to handle file uploads securely.

5. **Avoid using user-supplied data in system commands** (OWASP Command Injection Defense Cheat Sheet)
   - If the application executes system commands or shell commands, avoid using user-supplied data directly in those commands.
   - Use safe alternatives like `system('command', 'argument')` or `Open3.capture3` to properly escape arguments.

## 5. HTTP Security Headers

1. **Enable default security headers using `default_headers`** (Section 8)
   - Open the `config/application.rb` file and uncomment or add the `config.action_dispatch.default_headers` configuration.
   - Set appropriate values for headers like `X-Frame-Options`, `X-XSS-Protection`, `X-Content-Type-Options`, and `Strict-Transport-Security`.

2. **Implement Content Security Policy (CSP)** (Section 8)
   - In the `config/initializers/content_security_policy.rb` file, define a strict CSP that allows loading resources only from trusted sources.
   - Use the `rails-csp` gem to manage the CSP configuration more easily.
   - Test the application thoroughly to ensure the CSP doesn't break legitimate functionality.

3. **Enable HSTS with preloading** (OWASP HTTP Strict Transport Security Cheat Sheet)
   - In the `config/environments/production.rb` file, set `config.force_ssl = true` and configure HSTS with a long `max-age` value.
   - Submit the application's domain to the HSTS preload list to ensure HSTS is enforced by browsers.

4. **Set secure cookie flags** (OWASP Secure Cookie Attribute Cheat Sheet)
   - Configure the `Secure`, `HttpOnly`, and `SameSite` attributes for session and sensitive cookies.
   - Ensure the `Secure` flag is set for all cookies in the production environment to enforce HTTPS.

## 6. Intranet and Admin Security

1. **Implement strong authentication and authorization for admin interfaces** (Section 9)
   - Review the admin interface controllers and ensure they use strong authentication and authorization mechanisms.
   - Use a library like Devise or Pundit to handle admin user authentication and role-based access control.

2. **Restrict access to admin interfaces by IP or VPN** (Section 9)
   - Implement network-level access controls to limit access to the admin interfaces.
   - Use IP whitelisting or require admin users to connect through a secure VPN.

3. **Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA) for admin users** (Section 9)
   - Implement MFA for admin user accounts to add an extra layer of security.
   - Use libraries like `devise-two-factor` or `two_factor_authentication` to enable MFA.

4. **Implement rate limiting and brute-force protection** (OWASP Blocking Brute Force Attacks)
   - Add rate limiting and brute-force protection mechanisms to the admin login and sensitive actions.
   - Use libraries like `rack-attack` or `rack-throttle` to implement rate limiting based on IP, user, or other criteria.

5. **Monitor and log admin activities** (OWASP Logging Cheat Sheet)
   - Implement detailed logging and monitoring for all admin actions, including login attempts, configuration changes, and sensitive data access.
   - Use a centralized logging solution and regularly review the logs for suspicious activities or anomalies.

## 7. Environmental Security

1. **Use environment variables for sensitive configuration** (Section 10)
   - Review the `config` directory and ensure sensitive information like database credentials and secret keys are not hardcoded.
   - Move sensitive configuration to environment variables or use encrypted credential storage mechanisms provided by Rails.

2. **Implement secure backup and recovery processes** (Section 10)
   - Establish a secure backup and recovery process for the application's data and configurations.
   - Ensure backups are encrypted, stored securely, and regularly tested for integrity and recoverability.

3. **Secure server and infrastructure configuration** (OWASP Secure Configuration Guide)
   - Follow best practices for securing the server and infrastructure hosting the Rails application.
   - Regularly apply security patches, harden server configurations, and restrict access to sensitive resources.

4. **Use secure communication channels** (OWASP Transport Layer Protection Cheat Sheet)
   - Ensure all communication between the application, servers, and external services uses secure protocols like HTTPS or SSH.
   - Properly validate and verify SSL/TLS certificates to prevent man-in-the-middle attacks.

## 8. Dependency Management

1. **Regularly update and patch dependencies** (Section 11)
   - Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `brakeman` to scan the `Gemfile.lock` for known vulnerabilities.
   - Update the application's dependencies, including Rails, Ruby, and third-party gems, to the latest stable and secure versions.

2. **Implement a dependency management process** (Section 11)
   - Establish a process to monitor for new releases, security patches, and CVEs related to the application's dependencies.
   - Subscribe to security mailing lists and keep an eye on the GitHub repositories of the dependencies for any security announcements.

3. **Integrate dependency auditing into CI/CD pipeline** (Section 11)
   - Set up a continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD) pipeline that includes automated vulnerability scanning and dependency checking.
   - Use tools like `bundler-audit` or `brakeman` in the CI/CD process to identify and alert on any security issues introduced by dependency updates.

4. **Minimize and isolate dependencies** (OWASP Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities)
   - Review the application's dependencies and remove any unnecessary or unused gems to reduce the attack surface.
   - Use tools like `bundler-leak` to identify gems with known vulnerabilities and consider alternatives or mitigations.

5. **Monitor for new vulnerabilities and security advisories** (OWASP Vulnerability Disclosure Cheat Sheet)
   - Regularly monitor security advisories, mailing lists, and vulnerability databases for new issues related to the application's dependencies.
   - Establish a process to assess the impact of newly discovered vulnerabilities and prioritize their remediation based on risk.
