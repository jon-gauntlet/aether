# Gauntlet Optimization System

A comprehensive system for maintaining peak performance during extended development sessions.

## Components

### 1. System Optimizer (`optimize_system.sh`)
- Configures the development environment for optimal performance
- Sets up directory structure and monitoring
- Initializes focus protection and recovery protocols
- Creates necessary symlinks and configurations

### 2. Focus State Manager (`focus_state_manager.sh`)
- Monitors and manages focus states during development
- Tracks energy levels and suggests breaks
- Provides automatic context saving
- Integrates with system notifications

## Focus States

- **FLOW**: Deep work, maximum productivity
- **ACTIVE**: Engaged but not peak flow
- **TIRED**: Reduced energy, needs break
- **RECOVERY**: Active recovery period

## Usage

### Initial Setup
```bash
./optimize_system.sh
```

### Focus State Commands
```bash
# Start a session
focus_state_manager.sh start

# Enter flow state
focus_state_manager.sh flow

# Take a break
focus_state_manager.sh break

# Check current state
focus_state_manager.sh status
```

### Automatic Monitoring
The focus state manager runs as a systemd user service (`gauntlet-focus.service`), automatically monitoring your activity and suggesting breaks when needed.

## Directory Structure

```
~/.gauntlet/
├── system/
│   ├── focus_rules.conf
│   └── recovery/
├── context/
│   ├── current/
│   └── backup/
├── metrics/
│   └── monitoring/
├── state/
└── logs/
```

## Features

1. **Automatic State Detection**
   - Monitors idle time
   - Detects flow states
   - Suggests breaks based on activity patterns

2. **Focus Protection**
   - Blocks notifications during flow states
   - Preserves context during breaks
   - Manages energy levels

3. **Recovery Protocols**
   - Automatic context saving
   - State restoration after breaks
   - Progress preservation

4. **Metrics Tracking**
   - Focus state history
   - Energy level monitoring
   - Performance tracking

## Best Practices

1. **Flow State Management**
   - Don't interrupt flow states unless necessary
   - Take breaks when suggested
   - Use recovery periods effectively

2. **Context Preservation**
   - Let the system handle context saving
   - Use recovery protocols for breaks
   - Maintain clean workspace state

3. **Energy Management**
   - Follow break suggestions
   - Use recovery periods for actual recovery
   - Monitor energy levels throughout sessions
