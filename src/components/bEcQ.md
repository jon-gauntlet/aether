# Findings Schema and Scoring

## 1. Vulnerability Categories
   - Injection Flaws
   - Authentication and Session Management
   - Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
   - Insecure Direct Object References
   - Security Misconfiguration
   - Sensitive Data Exposure
   - Missing Function Level Access Control
   - Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
   - Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities
   - Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards

## 2. Severity Ratings
   - Critical: Vulnerabilities that pose an immediate and significant risk to the application and its users
   - High: Vulnerabilities that can lead to severe consequences if exploited
   - Medium: Vulnerabilities that have a moderate impact on the application's security
   - Low: Vulnerabilities with limited impact or low likelihood of exploitation
   - Informational: Issues that do not pose a direct security risk but may require attention

## 3. Scoring Criteria
   - Impact: The potential consequences of the vulnerability if exploited
     - Confidentiality: The extent to which sensitive data can be accessed or disclosed
     - Integrity: The extent to which data or functionality can be altered or compromised
     - Availability: The extent to which the application or its services can be disrupted
   - Likelihood: The ease and probability of exploiting the vulnerability
     - Skill Level: The technical expertise required to exploit the vulnerability
     - Access Vector: The channels or methods through which the vulnerability can be exploited
     - Authentication: The level of authentication required to exploit the vulnerability

## 4. Scoring Matrix
   - The scoring matrix combines the impact and likelihood factors to determine the overall severity of a vulnerability
   - The matrix provides a consistent and standardized approach to prioritizing and communicating the risk level of identified issues

## 5. Remediation Prioritization
   - Vulnerabilities with higher severity ratings should be prioritized for remediation
   - The remediation effort and feasibility should also be considered when determining the priority of fixing identified issues
   - A risk-based approach should be followed to address the most critical vulnerabilities first while balancing the overall security posture of the application
