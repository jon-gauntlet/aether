# Aether Project

## Overview
Aether is a natural system evolution framework focused on optimizing development flow and pattern coherence. It provides tools for maintaining high-energy development states while ensuring code quality and system stability.

## Getting Started

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

2. Start development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

3. Run tests:
```bash
npm run test
```

## Configuration
Project configuration and state is stored in `.aether.json`. This file maintains:
- Current project state
- Core metrics
- Testing status
- Deployment configuration
- Context paths

## Contributing
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Maintain flow protection during development
3. Follow natural system evolution patterns
4. Preserve energy state coherence
