## 6. Recommendations

### 6.1. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

- **Actionable Steps for Mitigation**
  - Enable CSRF protection in all controllers.
  - Ensure all forms include CSRF tokens.
  - Review and restrict usage of `skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token`.

### 6.2. Session Management

- **Actionable Steps for Mitigation**
  - Configure secure session stores with unique keys.
  - Enforce HTTPS to protect session data in transit.
  - Implement session timeout and regeneration mechanisms.

### 6.3. User Management

- **Actionable Steps for Mitigation**
  - Utilize secure authentication libraries like Devise.
  - Enforce strong password policies and account locking.
  - Regularly audit user roles and permissions.

### 6.4. Injection

- **Actionable Steps for Mitigation**
  - Refactor raw SQL queries to use Active Record methods.
  - Validate and sanitize all user inputs used in queries.
  - Implement parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.

### 6.5. HTTP Security Headers
