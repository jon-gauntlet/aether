# Guiding Principles

## Natural Flow
Our system recognizes and respects the natural rhythms of human presence and attention. Like a river finding its course, we do not force but rather support the natural tendencies of consciousness.

### Depth and Stillness
- Depth emerges naturally from sustained stillness
- Each moment builds upon the previous
- Protection increases with depth
- Different activities have their natural rhythms

### Presence and Clarity
- True presence cannot be forced
- Clarity arises from the combination of depth and stillness
- Each type of presence has its own character
- Natural transitions between states

### Spaces
- Different spaces support different modes of being
- Each space has its natural qualities
- Some spaces gather, others protect
- Movement between spaces follows natural patterns

## Connection Patterns
The system recognizes that human connection follows organic patterns, each with its own nature and rhythm.

### Resonance
- Builds naturally between compatible states
- Flows more freely in some spaces than others
- Different activities have natural affinities
- Shared depth creates stronger bonds

### Protection
- Deep states require protection
- Protection increases gradually
- Different spaces offer different levels of shelter
- Natural boundaries emerge organically

## Flow States
The system recognizes and protects valuable states of consciousness:

1. **Gathering** - The natural collection of attention
2. **Deepening** - The gradual movement into depth
3. **Deep** - The achievement of true focus
4. **Protected** - The highest state of immersion

## Spaces
Each space has its own character and purpose:

### Sanctuary
- For deep contemplation
- Highest stillness
- Protected presence
- Limited resonance

### Library
- For focused study
- High stillness
- Deeper presence
- Selective connection

### Garden
- For natural conversation
- Good stillness
- High presence gathering
- Strong resonance

### Workshop
- For active creation
- Moderate stillness
- Strong presence
- Good resonance

### Commons
- For open gathering
- Light stillness
- Highest presence gathering
- Free-flowing resonance

## Implementation Principles

### Natural Over Forced
- Work with natural tendencies
- Support rather than enforce
- Allow organic transitions
- Respect natural rhythms

### Protection Over Productivity
- Protect valuable states
- Guard against disruption
- Support sustained depth
- Enable natural recovery

### Connection Over Collection
- Foster genuine resonance
- Support natural grouping
- Enable deep sharing
- Preserve individual space

### Depth Over Activity
- Value true depth over mere movement
- Support sustained presence
- Protect growing stillness
- Honor natural cycles

## Building Practices

### Mindful Development
- Each addition should respect natural patterns
- New features should support, not disrupt
- Changes should feel organic
- Growth should be natural

### Hidden Harmony
- Components should work in harmony
- Transitions should be smooth
- Protection should be unobtrusive
- Support should feel natural

### Living System
- The system grows like a garden
- Each part influences the whole
- Natural patterns emerge
- Balance is maintained
