## Implementation Wisdom
The implementation wisdom and patterns from this project are stored in the stable system location:
`/home/jon/.local/share/aether/wisdom/patterns/autonomic_agile.md`

This location is part of the larger wisdom system:
```
/home/jon/.local/share/aether/
├── wisdom/          # Implementation wisdom
│   ├── patterns/    # Core patterns
│   ├── principles/  # Core principles
│   └── practices/   # Development practices
├── contexts/        # Context definitions
├── learnings/       # Project learnings
└── meta/           # System metadata
```

## Context Integration
The project automatically integrates with this wisdom through:
1. `.cursorrules` - References external context paths
2. `~/.config/cursor/contexts/index.md` - Global context index
3. Context Management System - Automatic pattern recognition

## Usage
When working in this project:
1. Implementation patterns are automatically loaded
2. Development principles are integrated
3. Context awareness is maintained
4. Learning is preserved externally

## Protection
Project-specific files remain in the repository, while:
- Implementation wisdom is stored externally
- Learning is preserved in the stable system
- Context is maintained outside the project
- Patterns evolve independently

This ensures that valuable insights and patterns survive beyond the project's lifecycle.
