# Aether

A React TypeScript application designed to optimize development workflow through energy and flow state management.

## Project Status
ðŸš§ **Recovery Mode** - Project is being recovered from backup. See [RECOVERY.md](RECOVERY.md) for details.

## Core Features

### Energy Management
- Track and optimize mental, physical, emotional, and creative energy
- Flow state detection and enhancement
- Automatic energy decay and recovery mechanisms
- Visual energy state indicators

### Pattern Recognition
- Development pattern identification
- Pattern-based optimization suggestions
- Learning accumulation tracking
- Interactive pattern activation

### Autonomic Development
- Task-specific energy management
- Flow state optimization
- Pattern-guided development
- Performance metrics tracking

## Project Goals
1. Support 80-100 hours/week of focused development
2. Optimize for ADHD hyperfocus states
3. Maintain code quality through exhaustion
4. Build with AI effectively and ethically
5. Win the Gauntlet through sustained excellence
