1. LLM-Assisted Manual Testing (3-4 hours)
   - Focus on one security assessment category at a time, following the approach demonstrated in the SpecStory links.
   - Engage with the LLM to search for specific vulnerabilities in `@codebase[app]`, leveraging its knowledge and analysis capabilities.
   - Document findings and insights, aligning them with the corresponding security assessment category.
   - Regularly review progress and adjust the approach as needed to ensure comprehensive coverage.

2. SAST and DAST Tool Execution (2-3 hours)
   - Run selected SAST and DAST tools against `@codebase[app]`, following the setup and configuration guidelines.
   - Monitor the tool execution progress and address any issues or errors that arise.
   - Collect and organize the tool output for further analysis and integration.

3. Data Normalization and Integration (1-2 hours)
   - Follow the guidelines in `tools/data-normalization.md` to normalize data from SAST and DAST tools using JSON and Python.
   - Integrate the normalized data with findings from manual testing for a comprehensive view of the application's security posture.
   - Document any challenges or insights encountered during the data normalization and integration process.

4. Progress Review and Planning (30 minutes)
   - Review the progress made in each area (manual testing, SAST/DAST, data normalization) and update relevant notes or log files.
   - Identify any blockers or areas requiring additional attention and devise a plan to address them.
   - Update the `planning/daily-work-plan.md` file with tasks for the next day, focusing on the next security assessment category and ongoing activities.
