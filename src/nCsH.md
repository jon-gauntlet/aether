  - `assessment-methodology.md`: Assessment methodology and approach, including tools, techniques, and best practices.
  - `findings-schema-and-scoring.md`: Schema for documenting findings and scoring system based on severity and impact.
  - `final-report.md`: Final security assessment report, including executive summary, detailed findings, and recommendations.
- `notes/`: Contains supporting notes and research materials.
  - `meeting-notes/`: Meeting notes and discussions with the Binti team and security experts.
  - `research/`: Research materials and references, including OWASP Top 10, OWASP Ruby on Rails Cheatsheet, and Rails Security Guide.
- `scripts/`: Contains automation scripts for project organization and management.
- `README.md`: Project overview, structure, and guidelines.

## Getting Started
1. Review the `deliverable/prompt.md` file to understand the assignment requirements, scope, and timeline.
2. Follow the assessment methodology outlined in `deliverable/assessment-methodology.md`, leveraging industry-standard tools and techniques.
3. Document findings using the schema and scoring system defined in `deliverable/findings-schema-and-scoring.md`, prioritizing high-impact vulnerabilities.
4. Compile the final security assessment report in `deliverable/final-report.md`, including an executive summary, detailed findings, and actionable recommendations.
5. Collaborate with the Binti team to review findings, discuss remediation strategies, and ensure the report meets their expectations and requirements.

## Quality Assurance
- Aim for a 100/100 quality score in all aspects of the project, from documentation to deliverables.
- Regularly review and refactor code, documentation, and project structure to maintain clarity, conciseness, and adherence to best practices.
- Engage with the Binti team and security experts to validate findings, recommendations, and ensure the report's relevance and effectiveness.
- Utilize industry-standard resources, such as OWASP Top 10, OWASP Ruby on Rails Cheatsheet, and Rails Security Guide, to inform the assessment and recommendations.
