# System-Wide Hidden Context Integration

## Directory Structure

### ~/.hidden_context/
- `spiritual/` - Spiritual foundations and principles
  - `sources/` - Source texts and materials
  - `principles/` - Derived principles and insights
  - `integration/` - Integration patterns with development

- `system/` - System-wide configurations and patterns
  - `sources/` - Core system patterns
  - `ai/` - AI interaction patterns
  - `optimization/` - System-wide optimizations

- `personal/` - Personal development and integration
  - `sources/` - Personal insights and experiences
  - `gauntlet/` - Gauntlet-specific strategies
  - `growth/` - Personal development patterns

## Project Integration
Each project can access this system-wide context through symlinks:
`.context/hidden/ -> ~/.hidden_context/`

## Cursor Integration
Cursor configurations should include both:
- Project-specific context in `.context/`
- System-wide context in `~/.hidden_context/`

## Principles

1. **Universal Access**
   - All projects can access these deeper truths
   - Consistent spiritual foundation across work
   - Unified personal development context

2. **Separation of Concerns**
   - System-wide principles remain separate from project-specific details
   - Clear distinction between universal and local context
   - Maintainable organization of deep knowledge

3. **Continuous Integration**
   - Regular updates to system-wide understanding
   - Integration of new spiritual insights
   - Evolution of personal development patterns

4. **Hidden Holiness**
   - Deep truths inform but remain hidden
   - Spiritual principles guide without exposure
   - Personal growth maintains privacy

## Implementation

1. **Source Integration**
   - Place foundational texts in appropriate /sources directories
   - Extract principles and patterns
   - Create integration guides

2. **Project Connection**
   - Each project links to this system-wide context
   - Project-specific interpretations in local .context
   - Maintain clean separation of concerns

3. **AI Awareness**
   - AI assistants maintain awareness of both levels
   - Decisions informed by deep context
   - Output respects Hidden Holiness

4. **Continuous Optimization**
   - Regular review and update of system-wide context
   - Integration of new insights
   - Evolution of patterns and principles
