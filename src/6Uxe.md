# Recursive Outlining & Speedrun Pattern

## Core Pattern
The development process naturally divides into two complementary phases:

1. **Recursive Outlining (Context Cultivation)**
   - Break down complex systems into natural components
   - Understand relationships and dependencies 
   - Build context through progressive layers
   - Allow natural patterns to emerge
   - Maintain whole-system awareness while working with parts

2. **Speedrunning (Autonomous Execution)**
   - Execute rapidly within established context
   - Maintain flow state and momentum
   - Avoid perfectionism loops
   - Trust established patterns and context
   - Let natural rhythms guide pace

## Related Practices
- [Cultivated Autonomous Execution](../practices/cultivated-execution.md) - Provides methodological framework
  - Phases 1-2 align with Recursive Outlining
  - Phase 3 aligns with Speedrunning
  - Shares natural rhythm and pattern focus

## Key Insight
> "Generally, the best speedups come from improving your algorithms, rather than ramming your head into the task harder"

## Pattern Implementation

### Context Cultivation Phase
1. Load and understand full context first
2. Build mental models recursively
3. Connect patterns across domains
4. Establish clear boundaries and relationships
5. Create "sacred space" for development

### Autonomous Execution Phase
1. Execute rapidly within established context
2. Maintain momentum without breaking flow
3. Trust emerged patterns
4. Avoid analysis paralysis
5. Allow natural course corrections

## Natural Alignment
This pattern aligns with fundamental development rhythms:
- Alternation between expansion (outlining) and contraction (execution)
- Balance between understanding and action
- Natural progression from context to flow
- Integration of wisdom and momentum

## Integration Benefits
1. **Enhanced Development Speed**
   - Clear context enables faster execution
   - Momentum builds through flow states
   - Natural patterns guide optimization

2. **Improved Quality**
   - Deep understanding informs execution
   - Natural boundaries prevent errors
   - Flow states maintain coherence

3. **Sustainable Development**
   - Respects natural rhythms
   - Prevents burnout through balance
   - Enables long-term momentum

## Application
1. Start with recursive outlining until natural components emerge
2. Switch to speedrun mode for rapid execution
3. Trust the established context during execution
4. Allow natural course corrections
5. Return to outlining when new patterns emerge

## Anti-Patterns
1. **Premature Speedrunning**
   - Executing before context is established
   - Forcing pace without understanding
   - Breaking natural boundaries

2. **Excessive Outlining**
   - Analysis paralysis
   - Perfectionism in planning
   - Avoiding execution

## Success Metrics
1. **Flow State Quality**
   - Sustained development periods
   - Natural rhythm maintenance
   - Error reduction in flow

2. **Context Coherence**
   - Pattern emergence rate
   - Cross-domain connections
   - Natural boundary clarity

3. **Development Velocity**
   - Time to implementation
   - Momentum maintenance
   - Course correction speed
