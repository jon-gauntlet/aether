# Security Issue Categories

1. **Authentication and Authorization**
   - User authentication mechanisms (e.g., password strength, multi-factor authentication)
   - Password storage and hashing
   - User authorization and access control (e.g., role-based access control, permission management)
   - Insecure direct object references (IDOR)
   - Mass assignment vulnerabilities

2. **Injection Vulnerabilities**
   - SQL injection
   - Cross-site scripting (XSS)
     - Reflected XSS
     - Stored XSS
     - DOM-based XSS
   - Command injection
   - Server-side request forgery (SSRF)
   - Unsafe deserialization

3. **Session Management**
   - Session fixation
   - Session hijacking
   - Insufficient session expiration
   - Lack of secure session attributes (e.g., HttpOnly, Secure flags)

4. **Sensitive Data Exposure**
   - Insecure storage of sensitive data
   - Insufficient encryption of data at rest
   - Exposure of sensitive data in logs or error messages
   - Insecure transmission of sensitive data (e.g., lack of HTTPS)

5. **Security Misconfiguration**
   - Improper security headers (e.g., X-XSS-Protection, X-Frame-Options)
   - Insecure default configurations
   - Outdated or vulnerable dependencies
   - Improper file and directory permissions

6. **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)**
   - Lack of CSRF tokens
   - Improper validation of CSRF tokens

7. **Broken Access Control**
   - Vertical access control issues (e.g., privilege escalation)
   - Horizontal access control issues (e.g., accessing other users' resources)
   - Insecure direct object references (IDOR)

8. **Insecure Cryptographic Storage**
   - Weak encryption algorithms
   - Insecure key management
   - Insufficient randomness in cryptographic operations

9. **Insufficient Logging and Monitoring**
   - Lack of logging for security-relevant events
   - Insufficient log analysis and alerting
   - Absence of audit trails for critical actions

10. **Unvalidated Redirects and Forwards**
    - Open redirects
    - Forwarding to untrusted sites without validation

When conducting the assessment, prioritize the categories based on their criticality and potential impact on the application's security posture. Focus on high-severity issues that could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, or system compromise.
