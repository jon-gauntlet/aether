# Development Best Practices üõ°Ô∏è

## Prevention First
- Configure IDE for real-time feedback
- Set up pre-commit hooks early
- Automate code formatting
- Enable continuous type checking
- Run tests on file changes
- Block commits that break standards
- Create environment verification
- Maintain dependency lockfiles
- Automate state backups
- Monitor system health

## TypeScript
See [TypeScript Guide](./guides/TYPESCRIPT.md) for core principles. Additional practices:

### Type Prevention
- Configure strict mode from start
- Set up IDE type checking
- Block implicit any at commit
- Verify exports are typed
- Monitor type coverage
- Catch type errors early

### Type System
- Enable strict mode in tsconfig
- No implicit any usage
- Explicit return types on exports
- Bounded generics only
- Prefer inference for internals

### Type Design
- Interfaces for public contracts
- Types for complex transforms
- Unions for finite options
- Intersections sparingly
- Keep constraints natural

### Type Safety
- Runtime type guards
- Validation at boundaries
- Error type hierarchies
- Exception handling
- Safe type assertions

### Type Performance
- Avoid type recursion
- Limit union size
- Cache complex types
- Monitor compile times
- Profile type impact

### Type Testing
- Test type constraints
- Verify type guards
- Check error cases
- Validate boundaries
- Monitor coverage

## React
- Set up component templates
- Use TypeScript from start
- Configure prop-types checking
- Add error boundaries early
- Enable React strict mode
- Prevent common pitfalls
- Use functional components
- Leverage hooks for state/effects
- Memoize expensive computations
- Avoid premature optimization
- Keep components focused
- Use prop-types in development

## Testing
- Write tests alongside code
- Set up continuous testing
- Block untested changes
- Maintain coverage gates
- Prevent test pollution
- Automate test runs
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep test files close to source
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test edge cases explicitly
- Mock external dependencies
- Maintain test isolation

## State Management
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use context for shared state
- Normalize complex state shapes
- Handle loading/error states
- Persist critical state
- Clear state on logout

## Performance
- Lazy load routes/components
- Use production builds
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize bundle size
- Cache expensive operations
- Monitor memory usage

## Error Handling
- Use error boundaries in React
- Log errors with context
- Provide user feedback
- Recover gracefully
- Preserve error state
- Report to monitoring

## Git Workflow
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches
- Rebase before merging
- Squash related commits
- Tag significant versions
- Keep main branch stable

## Code Organization
- Follow consistent patterns
- Group related functionality
- Use barrel exports
- Keep files focused
- Document architecture
- Maintain clean imports

## Build Process
- Use incremental builds
- Optimize for development
- Separate prod/dev configs
- Monitor build times
- Cache build artifacts
- Clean old builds

## Dependencies
- Keep dependencies current
- Use exact versions
- Audit regularly
- Remove unused deps
- Check bundle impact
- Use peer deps correctly

## Environment
- Use environment variables
- Keep secrets secure
- Document required vars
- Validate at startup
- Use strong defaults
- Handle missing vars

## Monitoring
- Track performance metrics
- Monitor error rates
- Watch memory usage
- Check build status
- Verify type coverage
- Monitor test coverage

## Development Flow
- Use consistent formatting

- Handle errors consistently
- Rate limit requests
- Validate payloads

## Debugging
- Use source maps

- Add meaningful logs
- Create repro cases
- Document solutions
- Share learnings

## Documentation
- Keep docs close to code
- Document key decisions
- Explain complex logic
- Update when changing
- Include examples
- Link related docs

## Optimization
- Profile before optimizing
- Measure improvements
- Document tradeoffs
- Test optimizations
- Monitor impact
- Revert if needed

## Deployment
- Use CI/CD pipelines
- Run pre-deploy checks
- Deploy atomically
- Monitor rollouts
- Enable rollbacks
- Verify deployments

## Recovery
- Create restore points
- Backup critical data
- Document procedures
- Test recovery
- Monitor success
- Learn from failures

## Team Workflow
- Review code changes
- Share knowledge
- Document decisions
- Maintain standards
- Support learning
- Build momentum

Remember: Prevention through automation and early feedback keeps quality high with minimal effort.
