# Redis Performance Baseline

## Current Performance Metrics (Staging)
Last Updated: 2025-01-19

### Resource Utilization
- CPU Utilization: 3-9% (target: <80%)
- Memory Usage: Tracking enabled (target: <80%)
- Swap Usage: 0MB (target: <50MB)
- Network Bandwidth: Within allowance
- Connections: Active monitoring

### Cache Performance
- Target Performance: 193K+ queries/sec
- Cache Hit Rate Target: >80%
- Memory Policy: volatile-lru
- Eviction Policy: Least Recently Used (volatile keys only)

### Monitoring Thresholds
1. Critical Alerts:
   - CPU Utilization > 80% for 10 minutes
   - Swap Usage > 50MB for 10 minutes
   - Memory Usage > 80% for 5 minutes
   - Connection Count > 1000 for 5 minutes

2. Warning Alerts:
   - CPU Utilization > 70% for 15 minutes
   - Memory Usage > 70% for 15 minutes
   - Cache Hit Rate < 80% for 30 minutes
   - Network Bandwidth > 70% of allowance

### Performance Test Results
- Single Node Performance:
  - Read Operations: Up to 200K ops/sec
  - Write Operations: Up to 100K ops/sec
  - Mixed Workload: 193K+ ops/sec
  - Latency: <1ms average

### Scaling Considerations
1. Vertical Scaling:
   - Current: cache.t4g.micro (staging)
   - Next Tier: cache.t4g.small (production)
   - Scaling Trigger: Sustained CPU >70% or Memory >70%

2. Production Requirements:
   - Multi-AZ deployment
   - Increased memory capacity
   - Higher network bandwidth
   - Enhanced backup retention

### Network Performance
- VPC Bandwidth: Within limits
- Network Latency: <1ms within AZ
- Connection Overhead: Minimal
- SSL/TLS Impact: Negligible

### Optimization Recommendations
1. Application Level:
   - Use connection pooling
   - Implement proper key expiration
   - Batch operations when possible
   - Use pipelining for bulk operations

2. Infrastructure Level:
   - Monitor memory fragmentation
   - Track cache hit/miss ratio
   - Analyze key size distribution
   - Monitor network metrics

### Cost Efficiency Metrics
- Current Cost: $25/month (staging)
- Cost per Operation: <$0.001
- Resource Efficiency: High
- Optimization Opportunities:
  - Key expiration policies
  - Memory usage optimization
  - Connection pooling
  - Batch operations
