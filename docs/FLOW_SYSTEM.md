# Flow System Architecture

## Overview
The Flow System manages state transitions between different focus and energy states, optimizing for ADHD hyperfocus conditions and sustainable performance. It integrates deeply with the Energy System to manage resource consumption and recovery.

## Core Components

### 1. Flow States
```typescript
enum FlowState {
  FOCUS = 'FOCUS',
  FLOW = 'FLOW',
  HYPERFOCUS = 'HYPERFOCUS',
  RECOVERING = 'RECOVERING',
  EXHAUSTED = 'EXHAUSTED',
  DISTRACTED = 'DISTRACTED'
}
```

### 2. State Transitions
- **Focus → Flow**: Triggered by sustained attention and optimal energy levels
- **Flow → Hyperfocus**: Requires high mental energy and controlled conditions
- **Any → Recovering**: Triggered by depletion or manual intervention
- **Any → Exhausted**: Automatic transition on critical energy levels
- **Any → Distracted**: Manual or pattern-detected transition

## Energy Integration

### 1. Energy Requirements
```typescript
interface EnergyPrediction {
  mental: number;
  physical: number;
  emotional: number;
  duration: number;
}
```

### 2. State-Specific Costs
```typescript
const baseCost = {
  [FlowState.FOCUS]: 0.2,
  [FlowState.FLOW]: 0.4,
  [FlowState.HYPERFOCUS]: 0.6,
  [FlowState.RECOVERING]: 0,
  [FlowState.EXHAUSTED]: 0,
  [FlowState.DISTRACTED]: 0.1
};
```

## Implementation Details

### 1. Flow Management
- State transition validation
- Energy requirement checking
- Duration tracking
- Recovery enforcement
- Efficiency optimization

### 2. Energy Optimization
- Flow state bonuses
- Recovery rate adjustments
- Depletion prevention

- Performance metrics

### 3. Metrics Tracking
```typescript
interface EnergyMetrics {
  efficiency: number;    // Overall energy utilization
  sustainability: number; // Long-term viability
  recovery: number;      // Recovery rate
}
```

## Key Features

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Flow Control
```typescript
const { currentState, transitionTo } = useFlow();

// Attempt transition to flow state
if (canTransition(FlowState.FLOW)) {
  transitionTo(FlowState.FLOW);
}
```

### 2. Energy-Aware Flow
```typescript
const { energy, optimize } = useFlow();

// Optimize for current state
if (energy.mental > 0.7) {
  optimize(FlowState.HYPERFOCUS);
}
```

### 3. Recovery Management
```typescript
const { enforceRecovery, startRecovery } = useFlow();

// Check and enforce recovery if needed
if (isEnergyLow()) {
  enforceRecovery();
} else {
  startRecovery();
}
```
