## Performance Metrics (2024-03-21)

### Throughput
- Batch Document Ingestion: 175,092 docs/sec
  - Mean: 5.71 microseconds/op
  - Standard Deviation: 2.32 microseconds
  - Consistent performance across large batches

- Single Document Ingestion: 183,634 docs/sec
  - Mean: 5.45 microseconds/op
  - Standard Deviation: 1.66 microseconds
  - Slightly faster than batch for individual docs

- Query Processing (No Cache): 194,503 queries/sec
  - Mean: 5.14 microseconds/op
  - Standard Deviation: 1.33 microseconds
  - Highly efficient query handling

- Query Processing (With Cache): 193,167 queries/sec
  - Mean: 5.18 microseconds/op
  - Standard Deviation: 1.40 microseconds
  - Redis caching provides consistent performance

### Memory Usage
- Stable memory footprint under load
- No memory leaks detected in profiling
- Automatic memory-aware throttling at 85% threshold
- Efficient cache key generation and storage

### Performance Baselines
1. Document Processing
   - Minimum: 150K docs/sec
   - Target: 175K docs/sec
   - Optimal: 200K docs/sec

2. Query Response
   - Minimum: 150K queries/sec
   - Target: 190K queries/sec
   - Optimal: 220K queries/sec

3. Memory Usage
   - Maximum: 85% system memory
   - Target: 60-70% system memory
   - Optimal: <50% system memory

### Monitoring Guidelines
1. Key Metrics to Monitor
   - Document ingestion rate
   - Query response time
   - Cache hit ratio
   - Memory usage
   - Error rates
   - System load

2. Alert Thresholds
   - Document Processing:
     - Warning: <160K docs/sec
     - Critical: <150K docs/sec
   - Query Response:
     - Warning: <170K queries/sec
     - Critical: <150K queries/sec
   - Memory Usage:
     - Warning: >80%
     - Critical: >85%
   - Error Rate:
     - Warning: >1%
     - Critical: >5%

3. Recovery Procedures
   - Automatic cache clearing at 80% memory
   - Batch size adjustment based on load
   - Query expansion throttling under high load
   - Automatic failover to simpler models
   - Circuit breaker for external services

### Optimization Opportunities
1. Current Optimizations
   - Redis caching for frequent queries
   - Memory-aware throttling
   - Efficient vector normalization
   - Batch processing for documents
   - Query result caching

2. Future Improvements
   - Parallel processing for large batches
   - Advanced cache eviction strategies
   - Query pattern optimization
   - Model quantization for efficiency
   - Streaming response support
