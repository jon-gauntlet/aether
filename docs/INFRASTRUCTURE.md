# Infrastructure & Deployment

This document outlines our infrastructure stack and deployment processes.

## Tech Stack Overview

### Frontend
- **React**
  - Modern functional components
  - React Hooks
  - Component memoization
  - Custom hooks for business logic

### UI & Styling
- **TailwindCSS**
  - Utility-first CSS
  - Responsive design
  - Custom color schemes
  - Flexbox and Grid layouts

### Build Tools
- **Vite**
  - Dev server
  - Hot module replacement
  - Build optimization
  - Asset handling

### Backend
- **RAG System** (Python-based)
  - Retrieval Augmented Generation
  - Knowledge base management
  - Query processing
  - API endpoints

## Deployment Process

### Quick Deploy
```bash
npm run deploy:flow     # Full protected deploy
npm run deploy:shield   # Extra protection
npm run deploy:restore  # Recovery mode
```

### Natural Process
1. **Energy Check**
   - System analyzes current energy level
   - Ensures > 70% energy for deployment
   - Preserves flow state
   - Auto-recovers if needed

2. **Type Safety**
   - Natural type healing
   - Pattern-based fixes
   - Flow-aware corrections
   - Zero friction

3. **Build Integrity**
   - Smart cache usage
   - Resource optimization
   - Pattern learning
   - Natural timing

## Infrastructure Components

### Hosting & Cloud
- **Vercel**
  - Production deployments
  - Preview deployments
  - Environment configuration

- **Firebase**
  - Firestore database
  - Authentication
  - Security rules
  - Indexes

### Containerization
- **Docker**
  - Development environment
  - Test environment
  - Production builds
  - Multi-stage builds

## Development Environment

### JavaScript Environment
- Node.js runtime
- npm package management
- Module bundling
- Asset optimization

### Python Environment
- Poetry dependency management
- Virtual environment handling
- Package versioning
- Development tools

## CI/CD Pipeline

### GitHub Integration
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Branch protection rules
- Automated testing
- Deployment triggers

### Quality Gates
- Linting checks
- Test coverage
- Build verification
- Security scanning

## Security

### Application Security
- Environment variables
- Firebase security rules
- API authentication
- Data validation

### Infrastructure Security
- Docker security
- Cloud service configuration
- Deployment security
- Environment isolation

## Recovery & Protection

### Quick Recovery
```bash
npm run deploy:restore  # Restore from failure
npm run flow:restore   # Reset energy state
```

### Protection Systems
- Type safety with auto-healing
- Build protection with cache optimization
- Flow guards for state preservation
- Pattern-based recovery

## Best Practices

1. **Energy Management**
   - Deploy during high energy
   - Use natural timing
   - Trust the system
   - Let patterns emerge

2. **Flow Protection**
   - Maintain flow state
   - Use recovery when needed
   - Follow natural cycles
   - Learn from patterns

3. **Type Safety**
   - Allow natural healing
   - Trust pattern recognition
   - Use energy-aware fixes
   - Preserve flow state
