# Implementation Progress
Last Updated: 2024-03-21

## Current Focus
- Resolving test environment issues with React 18 concurrent mode
- Fixing authentication test failures
- Improving error handling and token management

## Feature Status

### Authentication (PRIORITY 1) - IN PROGRESS ðŸ”„
- Local Supabase instance verified and healthy âœ…
- Environment variables configured correctly âœ…
- Test environment setup:
  - Migrated to Vitest with @testing-library/react âœ…
  - React 18 concurrent mode configuration in progress
  - Mock implementations for localStorage, fetch, and Supabase âœ…
  - Async operation handling being improved
- Test Status:
  - Token storage tests failing (3 failures)
  - Error message display tests failing (2 failures)
  - Logout functionality tests failing (4 failures)
  - Working on fixing concurrent mode issues

### File Handling (PRIORITY 2) - BLOCKED â›”
- Blocked by Authentication completion
- Storage bucket verified and accessible
- Initial test structure ready
- Implementation pending auth completion

### WebSocket (PRIORITY 3) - BLOCKED â›”
- Blocked by Authentication and File Handling
- WebSocket endpoint verified
- Initial configuration in place
- Implementation pending auth and file handling

## Recent Changes
1. Updated test setup for React 18 concurrent mode
2. Enhanced mock implementations for auth services
3. Improved error handling in AuthContext
4. Added proper cleanup after tests
5. Increased test timeouts for async operations

## Next Steps
1. Fix remaining test environment issues:
   - Resolve concurrent mode warnings
   - Improve async operation handling
   - Update cleanup procedures
2. Address test failures:
   - Token storage in localStorage
   - Error message display
   - Logout functionality
3. Document auth flow once tests pass
4. Prepare for file handling implementation

## Notes
- Test environment needs further configuration for React 18
- Using both REST API and Supabase for auth
- All auth tests must pass before moving to file handling
- Maintaining test coverage during fixes
