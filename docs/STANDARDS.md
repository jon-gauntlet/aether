# Development Standards & Best Practices ðŸŽ¯

## Core Principles

### Prevention First
- Configure IDE for real-time feedback
- Set up pre-commit hooks early
- Automate code formatting
- Run tests on file changes
- Block commits that break standards
- Create environment verification
- Maintain dependency lockfiles
- Automate state backups
- Monitor system health

  // Evolution
  readonly evolution: {
    patterns: PatternLearning;  // System growth
    spaces: SpaceGrowth;        // Natural scaling
    wisdom: SystemLearning;     // Knowledge base
  };
}

// Validation
interface ValidationResult {
  readonly valid: boolean;
  readonly errors?: readonly string[];
  readonly warnings?: readonly string[];
}

## Code Quality

### Core Standards
- [ ] Zero linting errors
- [ ] Consistent code style
- [ ] All exports documented
- [ ] Tests passing
- [ ] Errors blocked at commit

### Prevention
- Configure strict linting from start
- Set up IDE code checking
- Block errors at commit
- Verify exports are documented
- Monitor code coverage
- Catch errors early

### Code Design
- Clear function contracts
- Consistent data structures
- Predictable patterns
- Keep constraints natural
- Prefer simplicity
- Document complex logic

### Code Safety
- Runtime validation
- Input/output checks
- Error hierarchies
- Exception handling
- Safe assertions
- Test constraints

## React Development

### Component Standards
- Pure functions
- Hooks pattern
- Prop validation
- Error boundaries
- Performance optimized
- PropTypes validation

### Best Practices
- Set up component templates
- Configure prop-types checking
- Add error boundaries early
- Enable React strict mode
- Prevent common pitfalls
- Use functional components
- Leverage hooks for state/effects
- Memoize expensive computations
- Keep components focused

## Testing

### Core Standards
- [ ] Unit tests passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Coverage > 80%
- [ ] Snapshot tests current
- [ ] E2E tests passing

### Best Practices
- Write tests alongside code
- Set up continuous testing
- Block untested changes
- Maintain coverage gates
- Prevent test pollution
- Automate test runs
- Write tests before fixing bugs
- Keep test files close to source
- Use meaningful test descriptions
- Test edge cases explicitly

## State Management

### Standards
- Single source of truth
- Immutable updates
- Action tracking
- State persistence
- Error recovery

### Best Practices
- Keep state as local as possible
- Use context for shared state
- Normalize complex state shapes
- Handle loading/error states
- Persist critical state
- Clear state on logout

## Performance

### Core Metrics
- [ ] Build < 60s
- [ ] First load < 3s
- [ ] TTI < 5s
- [ ] Bundle < 250kb
- [ ] Memory < 100MB

### Optimization
- Lazy load routes/components
- Use production builds
- Optimize images and assets
- Minimize bundle size
- Cache expensive operations
- Monitor memory usage
- Profile before optimizing
- Measure improvements
- Document tradeoffs

## Security

### Standards
- Input validation
- Output sanitization
- Auth protection
- XSS prevention
- CSRF guards

### Best Practices
- Validate all inputs
- Sanitize user data
- Use HTTPS
- Keep tokens secure
- Handle auth properly
- Audit dependencies
- Use environment variables
- Keep secrets secure

## Development Flow

### Standards
- Continuous feedback
- Fast iterations
- Auto protection
- State preservation
- Clear communication

### Git Workflow
- Use meaningful commit messages
- Create feature branches
- Rebase before merging
- Squash related commits
- Tag significant versions
- Keep main branch stable

### Code Organization
- Follow consistent patterns
- Group related functionality
- Use barrel exports
- Keep files focused
- Document architecture
- Maintain clean imports

## Documentation

### Standards
- Keep docs close to code
- Document key decisions
- Explain complex logic
- Update when changing
- Include examples
- Link related docs

### API Design
- RESTful principles
- Version your APIs
- Document endpoints
- Handle errors consistently
- Rate limit requests
- Validate payloads

## Monitoring & Recovery

### Continuous Monitoring
- Error tracking
- Performance metrics
- User feedback
- System health
- Team velocity
- Code coverage
- Test coverage

### Recovery Procedures
- Create restore points
- Backup critical data
- Document procedures
- Test recovery
- Monitor success
- Learn from failures

## Team Standards

### Collaboration
- [ ] Knowledge shared
- [ ] Standards followed
- [ ] Reviews thorough
- [ ] Learning continuous
- [ ] Flow maintained

### Best Practices
- Review code changes
- Share knowledge
- Document decisions
- Maintain standards
- Support learning
- Build momentum

Remember: Standards and best practices should enhance, not impede, natural flow. Prevention through automation and early feedback keeps quality high with minimal effort.
