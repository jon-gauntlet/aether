# Week 1 Deliverable Plan (Due 3pm Today)

## Timeline
- Current time: 11:14 AM
- Deadline: 3:00 PM
- Available time: ~3.75 hours

## Critical Path Deliverables

### 1. Core Type System (60 minutes)
- [x] Basic project setup (TypeScript, React, ESLint, Prettier)
- [ ] Essential type definitions
  ```typescript
  src/core/types/
    ├── space.ts       // Space system types
    ├── flow.ts        // Flow state types
    ├── energy.ts      // Energy system types
    ├── protection.ts  // Protection system types
    └── index.ts       // Type exports
  ```

### 2. Basic Space Implementation (60 minutes)
- [ ] Core space components
  - Sanctuary (deep focus)
  - Library (learning)
  - Garden (exploration)
  - Workshop (creation)
  - Commons (collaboration)
- [ ] Minimal navigation

### 3. Flow System MVP (45 minutes)
- [ ] Basic flow state tracking
- [ ] Simple state transitions
- [ ] Energy level monitoring

### 4. Protection Mechanisms (45 minutes)
- [ ] Focus state guards
- [ ] Basic recovery system
- [ ] State preservation

### 5. Integration & Testing (45 minutes)
- [ ] Core system integration
- [ ] Basic test coverage
- [ ] Essential documentation

## Development Strategy

### Parallel Development
1. **AI Assistance**
   - Use multiple AI instances
   - Parallel file generation
   - Concurrent reviews

2. **Focus Areas**
   - Types & interfaces
   - Core components
   - Essential systems
   - Basic protection

### Quality Standards
- Clean, compilable code
- Basic type safety
- Essential tests
- Clear documentation

### Success Metrics
- Working type system
- Functional spaces
- Basic flow tracking
- State protection
- Passing tests

## Emergency Protocols
- Git checkpoints every 30 minutes
- Backup critical files
- Maintain working state
- Quick recovery paths

## Next Steps (Post-Deadline)
- Expand test coverage
- Enhance protection
- Improve documentation
- Add advanced features

## Notes for AI Assistants
1. **Speed Priority**
   - Focus on working code
   - Skip non-essential features
   - Maintain type safety
   - Keep it simple

2. **Quality Baseline**
   - Must compile
   - Must have types
   - Must be testable
   - Must be recoverable

3. **Development Flow**
   - Types first
   - Components second
   - Integration third
   - Tests fourth
