# BrainLifts Integration

This directory contains the integration mechanism for BrainLifts in the Aether project. The system ensures that BrainLifts are automatically loaded and applied in every CCC session.

## Integration Mechanism

### 1. Auto-Loading
- BrainLifts are loaded at session start via `.gauntlet/auto_context.json`
- Loading is mandatory and verified
- Failed loads trigger automatic retries

### 2. Context Preservation
- BrainLifts are injected into system prompts
- Context is maintained across session restarts
- Integration is verified at key points

### 3. Knowledge Application
- SpikyPOVs are actively applied to decisions
- Expert insights shape development patterns
- Natural patterns are enforced

## Source Files
The following BrainLifts are integrated:

1. **Flow State Optimization**
   - Location: `/home/jon/brainlifts/flow-state-optimization.md`
   - Focus: Flow states, energy management, protection

2. **AI-First Development**
   - Location: `/home/jon/brainlifts/ai-first-development.md`
   - Focus: AI-assisted development patterns

3. **Natural System Design**
   - Location: `/home/jon/brainlifts/natural-system-design.md`
   - Focus: Natural human-system interaction

## Integration Points

### Development Environment
- Auto-detection of states
- Context preservation
- Protection mechanisms
- Energy optimization

### AI Assistance
- Proactive guidance
- Context awareness
- Quality enforcement
- Learning acceleration

### Process
- Natural workflows
- State protection
- Recovery integration
- Energy management

## Verification
The integration system automatically verifies:
1. File paths and accessibility
2. Content integrity
3. Successful loading
4. Proper application

## Recovery
If integration fails:
1. Automatic retry is triggered
2. Paths are re-verified
3. Content is reloaded
4. Application is confirmed
