# Aether Frontend Implementation Progress

## Current State (2024-03-21)
- Working Directory: /home/jon/git/aether-workspaces/frontend
- Tests: Partially passing (test migration complete)
- Core features status:
  1. Authentication (PRIORITY 1) - IN PROGRESS
  2. File Handling (PRIORITY 2) - BLOCKED
  3. WebSocket (PRIORITY 3) - BLOCKED

## Recent Updates

### Test Framework Migration (Completed)
- âœ… Migrated E2E tests from Playwright to Vitest
  - Removed Playwright dependencies and configuration
  - Created new Vitest E2E test file: `tests/e2e/chat.test.jsx`
  - Updated test configuration in `vitest.config.js`
  - Configured browser testing with WebdriverIO
  - Preserved all existing test coverage
  - Using `@testing-library/react` and `happy-dom`

### Authentication (In Progress)
- âœ… Test infrastructure ready
- âœ… Local Supabase verified and healthy
- âœ… Found existing implementations:
  - Supabase client setup in `src/lib/supabaseClient.js`
  - Auth context in `src/contexts/AuthContext.jsx`
  - Session management implemented
  - Login with fallback (REST API â†’ Supabase)
  - Logout with cleanup
  - Error handling in place
  - Loading states managed
- ðŸ”„ Next steps:
  1. Debug Supabase auth integration
  2. Get auth tests passing
  3. Document auth flow
  4. Add comprehensive error handling
  5. Test session management

### Blockers
- File Handling: Blocked by Authentication
- WebSocket: Blocked by Authentication

## Next Actions
1. Run auth tests to identify failing cases
2. Debug Supabase auth integration issues
3. Fix any failing auth tests
4. Document auth flow in detail

## Notes
- Following code reuse first approach
- Focusing on authentication before other features
- All changes tracked in version control
- Test coverage maintained through migration
- Found existing auth implementation to build upon
