## Next Steps
1. Run tests to verify fixes:
   ```bash
   npx vitest run "websocket" --no-isolate
   ```

2. Verify specific functionality:
   - Connection management
   - Message handling
   - Authentication flow
   - Presence features
   - Performance metrics

3. Document any remaining issues
4. Plan next iteration if needed

## Commands Run
```bash
npm install -D vitest  # âœ… Completed
npx vitest run "websocket" --no-isolate  # ðŸ”„ Ready for retest
```
