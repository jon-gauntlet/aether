# Memory Test Failure Report

## Test Implementation
- Created test file: tests/performance/memory.leak.test.js
- Added script to package.json: "test:memory"
- Test monitors heap usage while sending 1000 messages
- Verifies memory growth is less than 50MB
- Checks that memory growth rate is not increasing

## Test Command
npm run test:memory

## Error
Connection refused on ws://localhost:8000/ws/test-channel
Same connection issue as WebSocket load test

## Environment
- Frontend worktree: /home/jon/git/aether-workspaces/frontend
- Branch: feature/frontend

## Impact
- Cannot verify memory leak requirements for 1000 messages
- Blocked by same WebSocket server connection issue
- Memory monitoring code is implemented and ready for testing once server is available

## Available Test Scripts
npm suggests: npm run test:perf
