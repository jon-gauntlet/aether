## 4 Redirection and Files

### 4.1 Redirection
- Redirection is a common technique used by web applications to redirect the user to a different URL
- Redirection can be used for:
  - Moving permanently
  - Temporarily moving due to maintenance
  - URL shortening
  - Logging outgoing links
- Redirection in Rails is typically done using the `redirect_to` method
- Example: `redirect_to root_url`

### 4.2 Redirection and Security
- Redirection can lead to security vulnerabilities if not handled properly
- Attackers can manipulate redirection URLs to:
  - Redirect users to malicious websites
  - Perform phishing attacks
  - Bypass access control checks
- Rails provides protection against redirection vulnerabilities by default

### 4.3 Unsafe Redirects
- Unsafe redirects occur when the application redirects to a URL constructed from user-supplied input without proper validation
- Example of unsafe redirect:
  ```ruby
  redirect_to params[:url]
  ```
- Attackers can manipulate the `url` parameter to redirect users to malicious websites

### 4.4 Safe Redirect Options
- Use a whitelist of allowed URLs for redirection
- Example of safe redirect using a whitelist:
  ```ruby
  ALLOWED_URLS = [
    'https://www.example.com/',
    'https://www.example.org/'
  ]

  def redirect
    url = params[:url]
    if ALLOWED_URLS.include?(url)
      redirect_to url
    else
      redirect_to root_url
    end
  end
  ```
- Validate user-supplied URLs before redirecting
- Use relative paths instead of absolute URLs for internal redirects

### 4.5 File Uploads
- File uploads can be a security risk if not handled properly
- Attackers can upload malicious files (e.g., viruses, malware) or execute code on the server
- Rails provides built-in support for file uploads using the `file_field` form helper and `params[:file]`

### 4.6 Securing File Uploads
- Validate uploaded files:
  - Check the file type and extension
  - Limit the file size
  - Scan for viruses or malware
- Store uploaded files outside the web root directory to prevent direct access
- Generate unique filenames to avoid overwriting existing files
- Set appropriate file permissions to prevent unauthorized access
- Example of secure file upload:
  ```ruby
  def upload
    uploaded_file = params[:file]
    if uploaded_file && uploaded_file.content_type == 'image/jpeg' && uploaded_file.size < 1.megabyte
      filename = SecureRandom.uuid + '.jpg'
      path = Rails.root.join('public', 'uploads', filename)
      File.open(path, 'wb') do |file|
        file.write(uploaded_file.read)
      end
      # Process the uploaded file
    else
      # Handle invalid file
    end
  end
  ```

### 4.7 File Downloads
- File downloads can also pose security risks if not handled securely
- Attackers can attempt to download sensitive files or execute arbitrary code
- Rails provides the `send_file` and `send_data` methods for file downloads

### 4.8 Securing File Downloads
- Validate the file path and ensure it is within the expected directory
- Use a whitelist of allowed file types for download
- Set appropriate HTTP headers (e.g., Content-Disposition) to force file download instead of rendering in the browser
- Example of secure file download:
  ```ruby
  def download
    filename = params[:filename]
    path = Rails.root.join('public', 'downloads', filename)
    if File.exist?(path) && filename =~ /\A[\w\-\.]+\.pdf\z/
      send_file path, type: 'application/pdf', disposition: 'attachment'
    else
      # Handle invalid file
    end
  end
  ```

Remember to always validate and sanitize user input, whether it's for redirection URLs, file uploads, or file downloads. Implementing proper security measures helps protect your application and users from potential vulnerabilities and attacks.
