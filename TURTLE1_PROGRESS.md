# Turtle 1 Progress Report

## Latest Updates (March 19, 2024)

### Recent Progress
- Fixed WebSocket URL configuration (removed duplicate `/ws` path)
- Implemented initial Playwright test suite
- Added proper test IDs to all components
- Improved error handling and reconnection logic
- Set up proper CORS configuration for WebSocket connections

### Testing Challenges & Feedback
- Current test/debug/retest cycle is too slow
- Tests are filling up the UI with multiple terminal instances
- Manual debugging of React applications should be avoided until basic functionality is stable
- Need to optimize test execution and improve the development loop

### Current Implementation

### Frontend
- `ChatContainer.jsx`: Core chat UI with channel selection and message display
- `useRealTimeUpdates.js`: WebSocket hook with error handling and reconnection logic
- Using Chakra UI for components and toast notifications
- All components now have proper test IDs for automated testing

### Backend
- FastAPI WebSocket server with channel support
- Detailed logging for debugging
- CORS configuration for local development
- WebSocket endpoints properly configured for channel-based communication

## Current Issues

### WebSocket Connection
- Connection is being established but not maintaining stable state
- Multiple rapid connections/disconnections during tests
- Need to investigate potential race conditions
- Tests timing out waiting for stable "Connected" state

### Development Loop Issues
- Slow iteration cycle
- Multiple running instances causing port conflicts
- Unclear error visibility
- Manual testing overhead
- Terminal proliferation during testing

## Next Steps

1. Optimize Test Execution
   - Reduce test timeouts from current 10s to 5s
   - Run only Chromium tests (remove Firefox/WebKit)
   - Disable retries for faster failure detection
   - Keep traces/videos only for failed tests
   - Run tests sequentially to prevent WebSocket conflicts
   - Reduce global timeout from 10 minutes to 2 minutes

2. Improve Development Loop
   - Implement better process management
   - Add automated server health checks
   - Create single command to start all required services
   - Add cleanup scripts for terminating processes
   - Implement better logging strategy

3. Stabilize WebSocket Connection
   - Add connection state debugging
   - Implement proper cleanup between tests
   - Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
   - Improve error reporting and state management

4. Core Features Status
- [x] Real-time messaging structure
- [x] Channel support
- [x] Basic UI
- [x] WebSocket endpoint configuration
- [~] Working WebSocket connection (partially working)
- [ ] Stable connection state
- [x] Message persistence
- [ ] User authentication
- [~] Automated testing (in progress)

## Debug Information
- Frontend running on port 5174 (5173 in use)
- Backend on port 8000
- WebSocket connecting to ws://localhost:8000/general
- Connection being established but unstable during tests
- Multiple test terminals causing UI clutter

## Development Guidelines
1. Maintain automated testing as primary debugging method
2. Avoid manual testing until basic functionality is stable
3. Focus on improving test execution speed
4. Keep terminal instances under control
5. Implement proper cleanup between test runs
