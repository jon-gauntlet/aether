# Core System Architecture

## Overview
This directory contains the core systems that power the autonomous development environment. The architecture is designed to support sustained high-performance development over extended periods (80-100 hours/week) while maintaining code quality and developer wellbeing.

## System Components

### Primary Systems
- **FlowSystem**: Manages flow state transitions and optimization
- **EnergySystem**: Handles energy distribution and management
- **PatternSystem**: Identifies and evolves development patterns
- **ConsciousnessSystem**: Maintains awareness and state coherence
- **FieldSystem**: Manages resonance fields and interactions
- **ProtectionSystem**: Ensures system stability and recovery
- **MetricsSystem**: Tracks and analyzes performance metrics
- **ContextSystem**: Maintains development context awareness
- **PresenceSystem**: Manages focus and attention states
- **NaturalSystem**: Handles natural development cycles
- **ThoughtStreamSystem**: Processes and analyzes thought patterns
- **SpaceSystem**: Manages development space dimensions
- **MindSpaceSystem**: Handles mental space organization
- **RecursionSystem**: Manages nested pattern structures
- **EvolutionSystem**: Evolves patterns and adaptations

### Integration
The `SystemIntegration` class (`src/core/integration/SystemIntegration.ts`) coordinates all system interactions and ensures coherent state management.

## Recovery Process
The system uses a pattern-based recovery approach, documented in `recovery_state.json`. Key aspects:

1. **State Management**
   - Each system maintains its state using RxJS BehaviorSubjects
   - States are synchronized through SystemIntegration
   - Recovery progress is tracked in recovery_state.json

2. **Pattern Evolution**
   - Patterns are continuously evolved and optimized
   - Success metrics are tracked and used for adaptation
   - Pattern stability is maintained above 0.7 threshold

3. **Protection Mechanisms**
   - Multiple layers of protection against data loss
   - Automatic recovery procedures
   - State preservation and restoration

## Development Guidelines

### Energy Management
- Monitor energy levels through EnergySystem
- Respect natural development cycles
- Use PresenceSystem for focus optimization

### Flow State Optimization
- Leverage FlowSystem for state transitions
- Use PatternSystem for workflow optimization
- Maintain high coherence through ConsciousnessSystem

### Recovery Procedures
1. Check recovery_state.json for current status
2. Verify system stability metrics
3. Follow pattern-based recovery if needed
4. Maintain test coverage above 0.95

## Architecture Principles

### 1. Stability First
- All systems maintain stability metrics
- Changes must maintain or improve stability
- Protection mechanisms are always active

### 2. Pattern-Based Evolution
- Systems evolve through pattern recognition
- Adaptations are tested before adoption
- Patterns are preserved in recovery state

### 3. Energy-Aware Development
- Energy levels guide system behavior
- Recovery is prioritized when needed
- Natural cycles are respected

### 4. Deep Integration
- All systems are interconnected
- State changes propagate appropriately
- Coherence is maintained across systems

## Future Development
Refer to the `next_steps` section in `recovery_state.json` for prioritized improvements and optimization targets.

## Recovery Status
Current recovery status and metrics are maintained in `recovery_state.json`. This file should be consulted before any major system modifications.

## Testing
Maintain test coverage above 0.95 for all systems. Tests are critical for:
- Stability verification
- Pattern validation
- Recovery testing
- Integration verification

## Performance Monitoring
Use MetricsSystem to track:
- System stability
- Pattern coherence
- Energy efficiency
- Development velocity

## Emergency Procedures
1. Check ProtectionSystem status
2. Verify recovery_state.json
3. Examine system logs
4. Follow pattern-based recovery
5. Validate through test suite

Remember: Stability and coherence are primary goals. Always verify system state before major changes.
