Aether Chat AI Integration Features:
1. Document-based RAG System: Allows users to query project documentation and chat history
- Uses OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
- Implements efficient vector storage with FAISS
- Features LRU caching for improved performance
- Includes comprehensive error handling and fallback modes

2. Real-time Integration:
- Seamlessly integrated with chat interface
- Provides visual feedback during AI processing
- Supports both real and mock modes for development
- Includes source attribution for RAG responses

3. Performance Optimizations:
- Batch processing for document ingestion
- Caching system with LRU eviction
- Asynchronous processing for better responsiveness
- Configurable chunk sizes and similarity thresholds

RAG System Implementation Details:
- Core RAG system is complete with production-ready features
- Uses OpenAI's text-embedding-3-small model for embeddings
- Implements FAISS for efficient vector similarity search
- Includes robust error handling and retry logic
- Features mock mode for testing and development
- Supports both single queries and batch processing
- Provides detailed source attribution for responses
- Maintains high test coverage across components
