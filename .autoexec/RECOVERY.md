# Recovery Process Learnings

## Overview
This document captures key learnings from the type system recovery process, focusing on strategies that worked well and patterns that emerged.

## Recovery Strategy
1. **Systematic Approach**
   - Started with comprehensive file recovery
   - Analyzed files before moving/renaming
   - Maintained clear organization boundaries
   - Documented progress continuously

2. **Type System Architecture**
   - Core domains identified:
     - Flow: Base system for energy and state management
     - Energy: Resource and power management
     - Space: Spatial organization and relationships
     - Consciousness: Higher-level state management
     - Protection: System security and boundaries
     - Autonomic: Self-regulation and automation

3. **File Organization**
   - Domain-specific directories
   - Clear separation of concerns
   - Consistent naming patterns
   - Centralized type exports

## Key Patterns Found

### Type Hierarchy
1. **Base Types**
   - Core interfaces in core.ts
   - Fundamental types shared across domains
   - Clear type boundaries and relationships

2. **Domain Types**
   - Each domain has its own type hierarchy
   - Clear dependencies between domains
   - Consistent interface patterns

3. **Type Guards**
   - Runtime type checking
   - Consistent validation patterns
   - Safety boundaries

### File Structure
1. **Domain Organization**
   ```
   src/core/
   ├── types/
   │   ├── core.ts
   │   ├── flow/
   │   ├── energy/
   │   ├── space/
   │   ├── consciousness/
   │   ├── protection/
   │   └── autonomic/
   ├── scripts/
   ├── prisma/
   ├── docs/
   ├── styles/
   └── config/
   ```

2. **Type Exports**
   - Domain-specific index files
   - Clear export patterns
   - Centralized type access

### Recovery Patterns
1. **File Analysis**
   - Check file contents before moving
   - Identify domain relationships
   - Preserve type hierarchies

2. **Import Management**
   - Fix relative imports
   - Maintain dependency order
   - Ensure circular dependency prevention

3. **Version Management**
   - Multiple implementations preserved
   - Clear version progression
   - Evolution history maintained

## Lessons Learned

1. **Type System Design**
   - Clear domain boundaries are crucial
   - Consistent naming improves maintainability
   - Type guards enhance runtime safety
   - Centralized exports simplify imports

2. **Recovery Process**
   - Systematic approach prevents data loss
   - Documentation aids decision making
   - Progressive organization works better than big-bang
   - Preserve multiple implementations when uncertain

3. **File Organization**
   - Domain-based structure scales well
   - Separate non-type files early
   - Maintain clear boundaries
   - Use consistent naming patterns

## Future Recommendations

1. **Type System**
   - Add automated tests for type guards
   - Document type relationships
   - Consider type generation tools
   - Add runtime validation

2. **Organization**
   - Maintain domain separation
   - Keep clear dependency order
   - Document type evolution
   - Regular system audits

3. **Recovery Process**
   - Start with systematic recovery
   - Document decisions early
   - Preserve uncertain implementations
   - Maintain clear boundaries
