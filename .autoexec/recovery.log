Started: 2024-01-10 16:45 PST

## Phase 1: Initial Recovery
- Executed comprehensive recovery script
- Recovered 45+ files from history
- Resolved naming conflicts
- Created initial structure

## Phase 2: Type System Organization
- Created domain directories:
  - autonomic/
  - consciousness/
  - energy/
  - flow/
  - protection/
  - space/
  - utils/
  - test/

- Organized flow type system:
  - core.ts: Base interfaces (Field, Wave, Resonance)
  - metrics.ts: Flow metrics interfaces
  - state.ts: Flow state and consciousness interfaces
  - stream.ts: Stream type definitions

- Created type exports:
  - Domain-specific index files
  - Root index.ts with all exports
  - Flow type hierarchy exports

- Documented type relationships:
  - Created README.md with type hierarchy
  - Documented dependencies
  - Added usage guidelines

- Organized non-type files:
  - Moved shell scripts to src/core/scripts/
  - Moved Python scripts to src/core/scripts/python/
  - Moved service files to src/core/services/

## Next Steps
1. Verify all type imports resolve correctly
2. Check for any remaining unorganized files
3. Consider adding automated tests
4. Document recovery process learnings
