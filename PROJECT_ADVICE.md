## Grading Criteria

Hello everyone,
I want to clarify the grading criteria for this week’s submission. This week, we’ll be focusing on enhancing your Slack applications with AI components. The key criteria for this week’s project are as follows:
Functionality: Ensure that one or more AI components are integrated into your Slack app and functioning properly. The AI should enhance the app’s existing functionalities—channels, DMs, messaging, and threads—without breaking any existing features.
AI Components: You can choose to implement one or more of the following:
A persona using text or voice that answers on your behalf when you’re unavailable.
A RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system that can interact with the entire Slack workspace.
A document-based RAG where stored documents can be queried (This is where you can use summary-lookup).
To pass, the AI components must be seamlessly integrated and perform their tasks effectively. :rocket:
I’ve updated the project doc with this information as well, so it all aligns. Good luck! (edited)
