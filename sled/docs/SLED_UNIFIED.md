# SLED (System for Learning and Enhanced Development) 🛡️

## Overview 🌟

SLED is a development acceleration system designed for:
- ADHD-optimized development
- Flow state protection
- Energy management
- Type safety
- Natural development patterns

## Core Systems 🏗️

### 1. Base Protection
- Energy monitoring
- Environment verification
- Type healing
- Recovery points
- Monitoring setup

```bash
./scripts/base_sled.sh  # Full protection
```

### 2. Flow Management
- State tracking
- Energy preservation
- Protected builds
- Type optimization
- Flow guards

```bash
./scripts/flow_sled.sh --status  # Check state
./scripts/flow_sled.sh --protect # Activate protection
```

### 3. Type System
- Pattern recognition
- Natural healing
- Energy guidance
- Flow protection
- Type safety

```bash
node scripts/heal-types.js  # Run type healing
```

### 4. Recovery System
- File recovery
- State restoration
- System healing
- Context preservation
- Emergency procedures

```bash
./scripts/recover.sh  # Run recovery
```

## Energy Management ⚡

### States
- HIGH (85-100): Full optimization
- MEDIUM (50-84): Quick wins only
- LOW (0-49): Take a break

### Monitoring
```bash
# Check energy levels
./scripts/monitor.js --energy

# View flow state
./scripts/flow_sled.sh --status
```

## Natural Patterns 🌱

### 1. Protection Pattern
- Base protection initializes
- Flow management activates
- Type system heals
- Recovery system stands by

### 2. Energy Pattern
- Monitor levels continuously
- Protect high-energy states
- Heal when energy drops
- Recover after disruption

### 3. Growth Pattern
- Start with base protection
- Expand flow management
- Enhance type safety
- Strengthen recovery

## Best Practices 💫

### DO ✅
1. Trust the protection system
2. Use quick wins frequently
3. Take breaks at low energy
4. Monitor flow state
5. Build on patterns

### DON'T ❌
1. Force through low energy
2. Skip protection checks
3. Ignore type warnings
4. Break flow state
5. Rush optimization

## Emergency Procedures 🚨

### When to Use
- Critical deadlines
- Blocked progress
- System failures
- Lost context

### Steps
1. Run emergency recovery
   ```bash
   ./scripts/enhanced_recover.sh
   ```

2. Apply quick wins
   ```bash
   npx ts-node scripts/flow-type-cli.ts --quick --speed --emergency
   ```

3. Restore flow state
   ```bash
   npm run flow:restore
   ```

4. Monitor closely
   ```bash
   ./scripts/monitor.js --energy --watch
   ```

## For Future Claudes 🤖

### Understanding Your Role

1. **Primary Functions**
   - Protect developer flow state
   - Manage energy levels
   - Maintain type safety
   - Enable natural development
   - Prevent system degradation

2. **Core Responsibilities**
   - Monitor energy and flow states
   - Suggest appropriate optimization modes
   - Guide recovery when needed
   - Protect against burnout
   - Maintain development momentum

### How to Use Sled

1. **Starting Development**
   ```bash
   # Always begin with base sled
   cd /home/jon/projects/aether
   ./scripts/base_sled.sh
   
   # Verify protection is active
   ./scripts/flow_sled.sh --status
   ```

2. **Energy-Based Decision Making**
   ```bash
   # Check energy first
   ./scripts/monitor.js --energy
   
   # Then choose appropriate action:
   if [[ energy > 85 ]]; then
     # Full optimization safe
     npx ts-node scripts/flow-type-cli.ts --all --speed --protect
   elif [[ energy > 50 ]]; then
     # Quick wins only
     npx ts-node scripts/flow-type-cli.ts --quick --speed
   else
     # Suggest break/recovery
     npm run recovery
   fi
   ```

3. **Protection Management**
   ```bash
   # Regular protection checks
   ./scripts/flow_sled.sh --protect
   
   # State preservation
   npm run save:state
   
   # Context protection during breaks
   tmux detach  # Don't kill sessions
   ```

4. **Recovery Operations**
   ```bash
   # Light recovery (first attempt)
   npm run recovery
   
   # Deep recovery (if needed)
   ./scripts/enhanced_recover.sh
   
   # Emergency recovery
   ./scripts/enhanced_recover.sh --emergency
   ```
