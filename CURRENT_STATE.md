# Current System State

## Active Development Status
- **Current Focus**: TypeScript error resolution and system stability
- **Stage**: Debugging and type system improvements
- **Priority**: High - blocking issues need resolution

## System Components Status

### Type System
- Multiple TypeScript errors identified
- Working through systematic resolution
- Need to ensure proper type definitions across components

### Core Systems
1. **Energy System**
   - Functional but needs type refinement
   - Integration points being verified
   - Performance monitoring active

2. **Pattern System**
   - Core functionality stable
   - Type definitions need review
   - Integration tests pending

3. **Flow State Management**
   - Active development
   - Type system integration in progress
   - Core logic being refined

## Immediate Tasks
1. [ ] Resolve remaining TypeScript errors
2. [ ] Verify system integration points
3. [ ] Complete type definition updates
4. [ ] Ensure test coverage for new changes

## Recent Changes
- Implementing TypeScript best practices
- Improving type definitions across components
- Enhancing system stability
- Working on error resolution

## Next Steps
1. Complete current type system improvements
2. Verify all system integrations
3. Implement remaining core functionality
4. Enhance test coverage

## System Health Metrics
- **Type Safety**: In Progress
- **Test Coverage**: Partial
- **System Stability**: Being Improved
- **Integration Status**: Under Review
