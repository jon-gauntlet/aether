# Aether

A next-generation development environment that integrates AI-first principles with natural system design.

## Overview

Aether is built on three core principles:
1. **AI-First Development**: Designed to work seamlessly with AI assistants
2. **Natural System Design**: Systems that evolve and adapt naturally
3. **Flow State Optimization**: Enhancing developer productivity through flow state

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/jon-gauntlet/aether.git
cd aether

# Install dependencies
npm install  # Frontend dependencies
poetry install  # Python dependencies
