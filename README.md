# Aether Core

Core functionality for the Aether project, focused on autonomous development and natural flow systems.

## Project Structure

The codebase is organized into the following key directories:

### `/src/core`

- `/energy` - Energy system implementations and utilities
- `/evolution` - Pattern and repository evolution functionality
- `/flow` - Flow state and system management
- `/integration` - System integration components
- `/js` - JavaScript utilities and helpers
- `/natural` - Natural system implementations
- `/pattern` - Pattern recognition and management
- `/patterns` - Pattern implementations and utilities
- `/protection` - System protection and guardians
- `/services` - Core services and implementations
- `/space` - Mind space and spatial system components
- `/system` - Core system implementations
- `/test` - Test setup and utilities
- `/types` - Type definitions and interfaces
  - `/autonomic` - Autonomic system types
  - `/context` - Context management types
  - `/energy` - Energy system types
  - `/flow` - Flow system types
  - `/patterns` - Pattern system types
  - `/protection` - Protection system types
  - `/space` - Space system types
  - `/utils` - Utility types
  - `/validation` - Validation system types

## Key Components

- **Energy System**: Manages system energy states and flow
- **Flow System**: Handles state transitions and natural flow
- **Pattern System**: Pattern recognition and management
- **Space System**: Mind space and spatial management
- **Protection System**: System protection and validation
- **Integration System**: Component integration and interaction

## Development Guidelines

1. Follow TypeScript best practices
2. Maintain clean directory structure
3. Use descriptive file names
4. Keep related functionality together
5. Document type definitions
6. Write tests for core functionality

## Contributing

1. Follow the established directory structure
2. Use appropriate naming conventions
3. Add necessary type definitions
4. Include tests for new functionality
5. Document changes and additions
