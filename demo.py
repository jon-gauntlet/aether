            Agile is an iterative approach to project management and software development
            that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and with fewer headaches. 
            Instead of betting everything on a "big bang" launch, an agile team delivers work 
            in small, but consumable, increments. Requirements, plans, and results are evaluated 
            continuously so teams have a natural mechanism for responding to change quickly.
